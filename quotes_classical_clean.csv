I also met, early on Ella Fitzgerald. Her songbooks are some of the most amazing bodies of work.|Johnny Mathis|['amazing']

I always wanted to be a zookeeper when I was growing up, and I've wound up a zookeeper! I've been working with the Los Angeles Zoo for 45 years!

I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students.|Carl Sagan|['education', 'science']

I am one of those who would rather sink with faith than swim without it.|Stanley Baldwin|['faith']

I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere.|Noam Chomsky|['power']

I am prepared to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.|Winston Churchill|['great']

I am two with nature.|Woody Allen|['nature']
I am utterly struck how, 300 years after his execution, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.|Peter Jennings|['religion']

I am very fond of truth, but not at all of martyrdom.|Voltaire|['truth']

I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don't take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It's like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.|Luc Montagnier|['car']

I balanced all, brought all to mind, the years to come seemed waste of breath, a waste of breath the years behind, in balance with this life, this death.|William Butler Yeats|['death']

I bear a charmed life.|William Shakespeare|['life']
I became a Republican because I trust people more than I trust government.|Heather Wilson|['trust']

I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, 'No, I won't do it, I won't behave his way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,' and then you do it.|Leo Buscaglia|['change', 'future']
I believe the Bible is the word of God from cover to cover.|Billy Sunday|['god']

I cannot trust a man to control others who cannot control himself.|Robert E. Lee|['trust']

I decided that now is the time to start doing the things that really interest me and I find important. It was in the 10 years of the MacArthur grant that I began working on my first book... and I began putting more work into environmental history.|Jared Diamond|['environmental']
I decided to run for governor because I got mad... I want to make government more directly accountable to the people.|Jesse Ventura|['government']

I did not just fall in love. I made a parachute jump.|Zora Neale Hurston|['love']

I didn't know what to expect from a famous movie star maybe that he'd be sort of stuck-up, you know. But not Gary Cooper. He horsed around so much... that I had a hard time painting him.|Norman Rockwell|['famous']
I didn't mind studying. Obviously math and the physical science subjects interested me more than some of the more artistic subjects, but I think I was a pretty good student.|Alan Shepard|['science']

I die the king's faithful servant, but God's first.|Thomas More|['faith']

I distrust camels, and anyone else who can go a week without a drink.|Joe E. Lewis|['funny']
I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do, because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.|Susan B. Anthony|['god']
I do a lot of work with the Dyslexia Institute because, for people with dyslexia who do not have parental support, it is a huge disadvantage. I was fortunate because my Mum was a teacher and she taught me to work hard.|Susan Hampshire|['teacher']
I do all the evil I can before I learn to shun it? Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it? If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up.|Mahatma Gandhi|['love']

I do not believe that politics in the long run is about individuals. It is about ideas.|Eliot Spitzer|['politics']
I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable.|Anne Morrow Lindbergh|['alone', 'patience']
I do not believe that the men who served in uniform in Vietnam have been given the credit they deserve. It was a difficult war against an unorthodox enemy.|William Westmoreland|['war']

I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.|Isaac Asimov|['computers', 'fear']

I do not know that any writer has supposed that on this earth man will ultimately be able to live without food.|Thomas Malthus|['food']

I do not pretend to know precisely what is on foot there but I think it pretty evident that there is a very free communication between that country and this body, and unless I am greatly mistaken, I see the dwarfish medium by which that communication is kept up.|Benjamin F. Wade|['communication']

I do not regard a broker as a member of the human race.|Honore de Balzac|['finance']

I do not say anything from jealousy.|Anna Held|['jealousy']

I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over so thankful a people.|Elizabeth I|['thankful']

I do not think it is an exaggeration to say history is largely a history of inflation, usually inflations engineered by governments for the gain of governments.|Friedrich August von Hayek|['history']

I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.|Joseph Campbell|['experience', 'life']

I don't design cars. I'm not a designer. I know what I desire to be built, I know what the end result is, the horsepower, the competition we'll be working against - but I leave it to the people who work with me to put it all together. I don't do anything.|Caroll Shelby|['design']
I don't design clothes, I design dreams.|Ralph Lauren|['design', 'dreams']
I don't divide architecture, landscape and gardening to me they are one.|Luis Barragan|['architecture', 'gardening']

I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense I call it intelligence.|Malcolm X|['intelligence']

I don't expect to try to get people to like everything I do. I want them to respect what I do.|Roger Goodell|['respect']

I don't feel right unless I have a sport to play or at least a way to work up a sweat.|Hank Aaron|['work']

I don't get off on romantic parts. But I often think if I had had my dental work done early on, well, maybe.|Morgan Freeman|['romantic']
I don't have a dime left. I am dependent on my friends for food and a small old-age pension.|Bela Lugosi|['food']
I don't have a problem believing in God and Jesus. But in Genesis one has to wonder about these sentences that just go on and end without finishing. The thought is unfinished. Where did Adam go? What is he doing? Hello? There has to be some pages missing.|Bill Cosby|['god']
I don't have a very quick sense of humor.|Florenz Ziegfeld|['humor']
I don't have any fear of intimacy, but rather thrive on it, which is rare in a public person.|Jack Nicholson|['fear']

I don't know how many sacred cows there are today. I think there's a little confusion between humor and gross passing for humor. That's kind of regrettable.|Bob Newhart|['humor']
I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood, important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people. They don't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners.|Marilyn Monroe|['good', 'society']
I don't know if there is a Democrat who necessarily doesn't believe health care is a right instead of privilege. There is a significant between us and the Republican Party on that issue.|Tom Vilsack|['health']
I don't know of a Democrat - whether they're a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn't think that it's important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.|Tom Vilsack|['health', 'home']

I don't know what the future may hold, but I know who holds the future.|Ralph Abernathy|['future']
I don't know what the secret to longevity as an actress is. It's more than talent and beauty. Maybe it's the audience seeing itself in you.|Joan Blondell|['beauty']
I don't know what your childhood was like, but we didn't have much money. We'd go to a movie on a Saturday night, then on Wednesday night my parents would walk us over to the library. It was such a big deal, to go in and get my own book.|Robert Redford|['money']
I don't know whether it's age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price.|John le Carre|['age']

I don't know who the hell Paul Lynde is, or why he's funny, and I prefer it to be a mystery to me.|Paul Lynde|['funny']
I don't know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.|Joan Collins|['age']
I don't know why people question the academic training of an athlete. Fifty percent of the doctors in this country graduated in the bottom half of their classes.|Al McGuire|['sports']
I don't know why women want any of the things men have when one the things that women have is men.|Coco Chanel|['men', 'women']
I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'.|Bob Newhart|['music']

I don't like formal gardens. I like wild nature. It's just the wilderness instinct in me, I guess.|Walt Disney|['gardening', 'nature']
I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled. Their virtue is lifeless and it isn't of much value. Life hasn't revealed its beauty to them.|Boris Pasternak|['beauty']
I don't like poetry that just slaps violent words on a canvas, as it were.|Anne Stevenson|['poetry']
I don't like political poetry, and I don't write it. If this question was pointing towards that, I think it is missing the point of the American tradition, which is always apolitical, even when the poetry comes out of politically active writers.|Diane Wakoski|['poetry']
I don't like rap music at all. I don't think it's music. It's just a beat and rapping.|Nina Simone|['music']
I don't like to talk about things where you're going to gt one side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics.|Loretta Lynn|['politics']

I don't like to work with assistants. I'm already one too many the camera alone would be enough.|Alfred Eisenstaedt|['alone', 'work']

I don't live for poetry. I live far more than anybody else does.|Charles Olson|['poetry']
I don't look my age, I don't feel my age and I don't act my age. To me age is just a number.|Joan Collins|['age']

I don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.|Will Rogers|['government', 'politics']
I don't mean to be funny.|Yogi Berra|['funny']

I don't mind that I'm fat. You still get the same money.|Marlon Brando|['money']

I don't need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod my shadow does that much better.|Plutarch|['change', 'friendship']

I don't take the movies seriously, and anyone who does is in for a headache.|Bette Davis|['movies']
I don't think I even knew how big we were at the time. It was mad. I gained a lot through East 17 and I'm grateful for being able to have that experience.|Brian Harvey|['experience']
I don't think I would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties. There's always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent.|Jesse Ventura|['death']
I don't think I'm going to do any good work this morning.|David O. Selznick|['morning']
I don't think I've ever felt that same kind of peace, the kind of serenity that I felt after acknowledging that maybe I was going to die of this TB.|Desmond Tutu|['peace']
I don't think a female running a house is a problem, a broken family. It's perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man.|Toni Morrison|['family']
I don't think a woman has to act like a man to show that she has strength.|Little Richard|['strength']

I don't think any person has any special knowledge about what God has planned for me and you any more than me and you do.|Willie Nelson|['knowledge']
I don't think anybody cares about unwed mothers unless they're black or poor. The question is not morality, the question is money. That's what we're upset about.|Toni Morrison|['money']
I don't think anyone should write their autobiography until after they're dead.|Samuel Goldwyn|['funny']
I don't think anything changes until ideas change. The usual American viewpoint is to believe that something is wrong with the person.|James Hillman|['change']

I don't think success is harmful, as so many people say. Rather, I believe it indispensable to talent, if for nothing else than to increase the talent.|Jeanne Moreau|['success']
I don't think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it wouldn't surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something. I mean, why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number?|Andy Rooney|['government']
I don't think the government should be in the trailer-park business. I don't think they know how to run a trailer park.|Billy Graham|['business', 'government']

I don't think there's anybody in America who thinks my personality is best suited to being Number Two.|Chris Christie|['best']

I don't think we're yet evolved to the point where we're clever enough to handle a complex a situation as climate change. The inertia of humans is so huge that you can't really do anything meaningful.|James Lovelock|['change']

I don't trust liberals, I trust conservatives.|Lucius Annaeus Seneca|['trust']
I don't try to describe the future. I try to prevent it.|Ray Bradbury|['future']

I don't want to spend the rest of my life in politics. When I'm finished with my term as governor, I'm going back to the life that's waiting for me in the private sector.|Jesse Ventura|['politics']

I don't watch a lot of television. Sports and news, that's it.|Larry Hagman|['sports']
I don't work very much, and I just sit here waiting for a script that I can't refuse - and I'm not talking about money.|Michael Caine|['money']
I doubt if you can have a truly wild party without liquor.|Carl Sandburg|['newyears']

I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed.|Karl Lagerfeld|['diet']
I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.|Rodney Dangerfield|['time']
I ended the war a horse ahead.|Nathan Bedford Forrest|['war']
I enjoy about 1 out of 100 movies, it's about the same proportion to books published that I care to read.|Jim Harrison|['movies']
I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I'm the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I'm not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I'm just relaxing and enjoying it.|Betty White|['family']
I enjoy life when things are happening. I don't care if it's good things or bad things. That means you're alive.|Joan Rivers|['good']
I enjoyed in every way my 12 years of playing Archie, and I wasn't personally sad about finishing a long job.|Carroll O'Connor|['sad']
I enjoyed the administrative work because it involved working with Congress, city council, and the mayor. I had never been a politician so it was fun - learning political maneuvering.|Harold H. Greene|['learning']
I exercise every morning. I do light weights - 5lb and 10lb arm exercises - and then lie and lift my arms and legs. It's all about keeping core strength. I do a lot of stretching too.|Larry Hagman|['morning', 'strength']
I exhort you also to take part in the great combat, which is the combat of life, and greater than every other earthly conflict.|Plato|['great']
I expect nothing. I fear no one. I am free.|Nikos Kazantzakis|['fear']

I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.|Isoroku Yamamoto|['fear']
I fear my enthusiasm flags when real work is demanded of me.|H. P. Lovecraft|['fear', 'work']
I fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up. What we have now are politicians. They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else.|Susana Martinez|['courage']
I fear that, in the end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists amounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the linguist than for the speculative philosopher.|Moses Mendelssohn|['famous']
I fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts.|Virgil|['fear']
I fear those big words which make us so unhappy.|James Joyce|['fear']
I feel fine, I don't care who the director is. All you have to do is know what your doing - all of us - everybody in the business - that's all you ask anyone - you know your job, I know mine, let's go do it.|Morgan Freeman|['business']
I feel less alone when I read the books of Ratzinger.|Oriana Fallaci|['alone']
I feel like 35. At 35 you're old enough to know something and young enough to look forward to what you can do with the knowledge. So I stayed at 35!|Michael Caine|['knowledge']
I feel like my honesty gives people the freedom to talk about things they wouldn't otherwise.|Jane Fonda|['freedom']
I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in the kindness of human beings. I am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that I cannot think of heaven and angels.|Pearl S. Buck|['faith']
I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They wake up in the morning and that's the best they're going to feel all day.|Dean Martin|['best', 'morning']
I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.|Frank Sinatra|['funny', 'good', 'morning']

I felt no pressure that my grandfather was famous and my uncle was famous.|Kim Weston|['famous']
I felt that it's best just to be as transparent as possible.|Rupert Murdoch|['best']
I figure if I have my health, can pay the rent and I have my friends, I call it 'content.'|Lauren Bacall|['health']
I finally decided one day, reading science fiction magazines of the time, I could do at least as well as some of these people are doing. So I finally made a serious effort.|Fred Saberhagen|['science']
I finally did work out a very good relationship with my father, but it was rough growing up. We had a lot of conflict, and I think it surfaced in many of my works.|Ira Levin|['relationship']
I finally know what distinguishes man from the other beasts: financial worries.|Jules Renard|['finance']
I find Jesus my confidant and companion, brother and savior our relationship is intimate, vulnerable, demanding yet comfortable and reassuring.|Malcolm Boyd|['relationship']
I find fault with my children because I like them and I want them to go places - uprightness and strength and courage and civil respect and anything that affects the probabilities of failure on the part of those that are closest to me, that concerns me - I find fault.|Branch Rickey|['courage', 'failure', 'respect', 'strength']
I find in working always the disturbing intrusion of elements not a part of my most interested vision, and the inevitable obliteration and replacement of this vision by the work itself as it proceeds.|Edward Hopper|['work']
I find it amusing on one level, poignant on another, when people try to get recognition from an outside source. It's sad.|Grace Slick|['sad']
I find it rather easy to portray a businessman. Being bland, rather cruel and incompetent comes naturally to me.|John Cleese|['business']
I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.|Thomas A. Edison|['success', 'work']
I find myself going to places where I really have no business, speaking to these people in a whole other field that I have no extensive knowledge of. But I do it very often because it scares me.|Alan Alda|['business', 'knowledge']
I find myself hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by party-spirit, which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few.|Alexander Pope|['best']
I find myself more at peace when I live in Europe.|Norman Granz|['peace']
I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.|Groucho Marx|['time']
I find that he is happiest of whom the world says least, good or bad.|Thomas Jefferson|['good']
I find very often that very ugly women have really handsome men and vice versa because they don't have any competition. Sometimes handsome men have avoided me.|Hedy Lamarr|['women']
I find, by experience, that the mind and the body are more than married, for they are most intimately united and when one suffers, the other sympathizes.|Lord Chesterfield|['experience']
I find, in being black, a thing of beauty: a joy a strength a secret cup of gladness.|Ossie Davis|['beauty', 'strength']
I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious.|Vince Lombardi|['good', 'great']
I firmly believe that the mission of religion in the 21st century must be to contribute concretely to the peaceful coexistence of humankind.|Daisaku Ikeda|['religion']

I followed the same diet for 20 years, eliminating starches, living on salads, lean meat, and small portions.|Gene Tierney|['diet']
I foresee the Chinese ruling the world. What are you going to do to stop it? No president of the United States will ever have enough power to stop the Chinese when they want to take over the world.|Evel Knievel|['power']
I fought for peace in the fifties.|Pete Seeger|['peace']
I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say any other way - things I had no words for.|Georgia O'Keeffe|['art']
I found enormous opposition to my religion. It's like if you want to strengthen your biceps, you lift heavy weight, as heavy as you can handle, and work your muscles against resistance until it grows strong. I had to do that with my religion.|Ricardo Montalban|['religion']
I found golf was too time consuming, but I did enjoy it.|John Wooden|['time']
I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.|Barbara Walters|['religion']
I found marriage somewhat stifling. I don't know that I am the kind of man who ought to be married.|Burt Lancaster|['marriage']
I found that I was getting a warm reception for my message of freeing you from the income tax, releasing you from Social Security, ending the insane war on drugs, restoring gun rights, and reducing the federal government to just its constitutional functions.|Harry Browne|['war']
I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn't possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There's a relationship to government about knights.|Harold Pinter|['government', 'relationship']
I found there was only one way to look thin: hang out with fat people.|Rodney Dangerfield|['funny']
I gambled and I lost. I failed in securing my options for this choice for myself, but I succeeded in verifying the Dark Age is still with us.|Jack Kevorkian|['age']
I gambled on having the strength to live two lives, one for myself and one for the world.|Ruth Benedict|['strength']
I gave in, and admitted that God was God.|C. S. Lewis|['faith', 'god']

I gave up on new poetry myself 30 years ago when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens in a hostile world.|Russell Baker|['poetry']

I get all fired up about aging in America.|Willard Scott|['age']
I get along with all the women singers, but especially Dolly Parton. We talk the same hillbilly language.|Loretta Lynn|['women']

I get no respect. The way my luck is running, if I was a politician I would be honest.|Rodney Dangerfield|['respect']
I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.|Francine Pascal|['romantic']
I get up at an unholy hour in the morning my work day is completed by the time the sun rises. I have a slightly bad back which has made an enormous contribution to American literature.|David Eddings|['morning']
I get up in the morning, do my e-mail, I check my e-mails all day. I'll go online and I'll buy my books at Amazon.com, but I don't want to buy all of them because I want to go to Duttons and I want to buy books from another human being.|Joseph Bologna|['morning']
I get very nervous whenever I think about it. I've never done a serious play, and I have such awe of the woman - she's really my only idol. It's going to be a big stretch - certain people come out on stage and your face muscles automatically tense and you get ready to smile.|Judy Holliday|['smile']
I get whatever placidity I have from my father. But my mother taught me how to take it on the chin.|Norma Shearer|['parenting']
I give thanks everyday that I've been able to take my craziness and make it work for me.|Fritz Scholder|['work']
I go and see anything that's visually new, any technology that's about picture-making. The technology won't make the pictures different, but someone using it will.|David Hockney|['technology']
I go to school the youth to learn the future.|Robert Frost|['future']
I got a Valentine's Day card from my girl. It said, 'Take my heart! Take my arms! Take my lips!' Which is just like her. Keeping the best part for herself.|Robert Orben|['best']
I got a poster from Columbia Records, and there's Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus, Ellington, Count Basie - everybody in that poster has died, I'm the only one left. And great players like Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan, it's hard to believe they're gone because we were all so close. But I believe in the future and the tradition will go on.|Dave Brubeck|['future']
I got through my teen years by being a bit of a clown.|Diane Cilento|['teen']
I got up one Christmas morning and we didn't have nothing to eat. We didn't have an apple, we didn't have an orange, we didn't have a cake, we didn't have nothing.|Muddy Waters|['morning', 'christmas']
I grew up between the two world wars and received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.|George Andrew Olah|['dating']
I grew up in a house where nobody had to tell me to go to school every day and do my homework.|Constance Baker Motley|['teen']
I grew up in a household where everybody lived at the top of his lungs.|Frank Langella|['home']
I grew up in a very religious family and it is the motivating force to every thing I do. I am fortunate to have had adults all around me who really lived their faith, in helping other people and doing the best you can do.|Marian Wright Edelman|['faith']
I grew up in this town, my poetry was born between the hill and the river, it took its voice from the rain, and like the timber, it steeped itself in the forests.|Pablo Neruda|['poetry']
I grew up like a neglected weed - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it.|Harriet Tubman|['experience']
I grew up not liking my father very much. I never saw him cry. But he must have. Everybody cries.|Charley Pride|['dad']
I grow daily to honour facts more and more, and theory less and less. A fact, it seems to me, is a great thing a sentence printed, if not by God, then at least by the Devil.|Thomas Carlyle|['god', 'great']
I grow old learning something new every day.|Solon|['learning']
I guess I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone's wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.|Marilyn Monroe|['life', 'love']
I guess I'm pretty much of a lone wolf. I don't say I don't like people at all, but, to tell you the truth, I only like it then if I have a chance to look deep into their hearts and their minds.|Bela Lugosi|['truth']
I guess because the shows were activist in their own way - the marriage of my public activism and my career activism, you know - people understand me very well. They also understand there's a very strong bipartisan part in all of this.|Norman Lear|['marriage']
I guess if people couldn't profit from war I don't think there would be war.|Lily Tomlin|['war']
I guess music, particularly the blues, is the only form of schizophrenia that has organised itself into being both legal and beneficial to society.|Alexis Korner|['legal']
I guess the nicest thing about being, I won't say famous but being popular is a more proper word for me to use would be that if you've got a recognizable name, a lot of times you can get people to do things for you ordinarily that you wouldn't get done.|Mickey Gilley|['famous']
I guess the real reason that my wife and I had children is the same reason that Napoleon had for invading Russia: it seemed like a good idea at the time.|Bill Cosby|['good', 'time']
I guess there is nothing that will get your mind off everything like golf. I have never been depressed enough to take up the game, but they say you get so sore at yourself you forget to hate your enemies.|Will Rogers|['sports']
I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work.|Neil Armstrong|['work']
I guess you'd call me an independent, since I've never identified myself with one party or another in politics. I always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as I can at the actual candidates and issues themselves, no matter what the party label.|Jackie Robinson|['politics']
I had a big troupe, a big army and it was a lot of fun. And, after 10 years of that, I just decided that I wanted to travel and do special dates. I go to Las Vegas these days.|Bobby Vinton|['travel']
I had a happy marriage and a nice wife. I accomplished everything you can. What more can you want?|Max Schmeling|['marriage']
I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn't have to promote myself. These days there's far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows. I hope the more didactic approach won't be lost.|David Attenborough|['hope']
I had a little insight into life that most kids probably didn't have. My mother was a schoolteacher, and my father was a social worker. Through his eyes I saw the underside of society.|Charles Kuralt|['society']
I had a lot of dates but I decided to stay home and dye my eyebrows.|Andy Warhol|['home']
I had a monumental idea this morning, but I didn't like it.|Samuel Goldwyn|['morning']
I had a sense of what leadership meant and what it could do for you. So am I surprised that I am sitting up here on the 62nd floor of Rockefeller Plaza? No.|Vernon Jordan|['leadership']
I had a terrible education. I attended a school for emotionally disturbed teachers.|Woody Allen|['education', 'teacher']
I had a very, very difficult relationship with my mother, who was supremely self-centred. She was hilariously self-centred. She did not really take interest in anything that didn't immediately affect her.|John Cleese|['relationship']
I had been feeling a little rum. I didn't think it was anything serious because years ago I felt a lump and it was benign. I assumed this would be too. It kind of takes the wind out of your sails, and I don't know what the future holds, if anything.|Maggie Smith|['future']
I had been offered a Hollywood contract before my 18th birthday. It gave me the spark I needed.|Gene Tierney|['birthday']
I had crossed the line. I was free but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a stranger in a strange land.|Harriet Tubman|['freedom']
I had found English audiences highly satisfactory. They are the best listeners in the world. Perhaps the music-lovers of some of our larger cities equal the English, but I do not believe they can be surpassed in that respect.|John Philip Sousa|['respect']
I had in mind a message, although I hope it doesn't intrude too badly, persuading Americans, and especially Southerners, of the critical importance of land and our vanishing natural environment and wildlife.|E. O. Wilson|['hope']
I had known Cole Porter in Hollywood and New York, spent many a warm hour at his home, and met the talented and original people who were drawn to him.|Gene Tierney|['home']
I had more clothes than I had closets, more cars than garage space, but no money.|Sammy Davis, Jr.|['car', 'money']
I had nearly finished school because I was making effort not that bad on that. But there was a law in Germany after the war. You could not make your final examination before 18, so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first.|Karl Lagerfeld|['war']
I had no books at home. I started to frequent a public library in Lisbon. It was there, with no help except curiosity and the will to learn, that my taste for reading developed and was refined.|Jose Saramago|['home']
I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the make-up made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked onto the stage he was fully born.|Charlie Chaplin|['time']
I had no occasion for an apron on that morning.|Lizzie Andrew Borden|['morning']
I had no romantic interest in Gable. I considered him an older man.|Gene Tierney|['romantic']
I had only one superstition. I made sure to touch all the bases when I hit a home run.|Babe Ruth|['home']
I had ordered long legs, but they never arrived. My eyes are weird too, one is gray and the other is green. I have a crooked smile and my nose looks like a ski slope. No, I would not win a Miss contest.|Jane Seymour|['smile']
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too!|William Shakespeare|['experience', 'sad', 'travel']
I had reasoned this out in my mind, there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death if I could not have one, I would have the other.|Harriet Tubman|['death']
I had seen birth and death but had thought they were different.|T. S. Eliot|['death']
I had someone call me this morning telling me they had somebody who would only work a certain number of hours a week because if they worked too many hours a week then they couldn't get their government assistance. And that person has multiple cell phones, and gets them new every month with new minutes.|Timothy Griffin|['morning']
I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.|Nina Simone|['freedom', 'music']
I had the good fortune of having a happy, closely knit family.|Carlos Fuentes|['family']
I had therefore to remove knowledge, in order to make room for belief.|Immanuel Kant|['knowledge']
I had three chairs in my house one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.|Henry David Thoreau|['friendship', 'society']
I had three points I wanted to make: That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who's not doing a good job. But I didn't make up my mind exactly what I was going to say until I said it.|Clint Eastwood|['good']
I had to satisfy the action fans, the romantic fans, the intellectual fans. It was a terrific burden.|Sidney Poitier|['romantic']
I had to weave and play around with a honey bear, you know, and I could wrestle with him a little bit, but there's no way you can even wrestle a honey bear, let alone a grizzly bear that's standing ten feet to eleven feet tall! Can you imagine? But it was fascinating to work that close to that kind of animal.|Leslie Nielsen|['alone']
I had used eclectic therapy and behavior therapy on myself at the age of 19 to get over my fear of public speaking and of approaching young women in public.|Albert Ellis|['age', 'fear', 'women']
I hadn't been in Vegas 20 minutes when I got word that the bookmakers were offering three to one that Frank wouldn't show for my wedding.|Sammy Davis, Jr.|['wedding']
I happen to think that computers are the most important thing to happen to musicians since the invention of cat-gut which was a long time ago.|Robert Moog|['computers']
I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend.|Elvis Presley|['business', 'music']
I hasten to laugh at everything, for fear of being obliged to weep.|Pierre Beaumarchais|['fear']
I hate all politics. I don't like either political party. One should not belong to them - one should be an individual, standing in the middle. Anyone that belongs to a party stops thinking.|Ray Bradbury|['politics']
I hate all sports as rabidly as a person who likes sports hates common sense.|H. L. Mencken|['sports']
I hate birthdays.|Zane Grey|['birthday']
I hate failure and that divorce was a Number One failure in my eyes. It was the worst period of my life. Neither Desi nor I have been the same since, physically or mentally.|Lucille Ball|['failure']
I hate fishing, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike when you can get in the car and drive.|Joseph Barbera|['car']
I hate housework! You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again.|Joan Rivers|['funny']
I hate newspapermen. They come into camp and pick up their camp rumors and print them as facts. I regard them as spies, which, in truth, they are.|William Tecumseh Sherman|['truth']
I hate organized religion. I think you have to love thy neighbor as thyself. I think you have to pick your own God and be true to him. I always say 'him' rather than 'her.' Maybe it's because of my generation, but I don't like the idea of a female God. I see God as a benevolent male.|Julia Child|['religion']
I hate politics. I like to write about it, but to get involved in it, to try and make a lot of ignorant people do what you want them to do, waste of time. Go and write a book. It's more important and it'll last longer.|Wilbur Smith|['politics']
I hate the actor and audience business. An author should be in among the crowd, kicking their shins or cheering them on to some mischief or merriment.|David Herbert Lawrence|['business']
I hate the idea of causes, and if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.|E. M. Forster|['hope']
I hate this fast growing tendency to chain men to machines in big factories and deprive them of all joy in their efforts - the plan will lead to cheap men and cheap products.|Richard Wagner|['men']
I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success.|J. Paul Getty|['failure', 'success']
I hate to say this, but I'll repeat it: After death, all we know that you do is stink.|Jack Kevorkian|['death']
I hate vacations. If you can build buildings, why sit on the beach?|Philip Johnson|['architecture']
I hate victims who respect their executioners.|Jean-Paul Sartre|['respect']
I hate war. Absolutely, I hate war.|Norman Schwarzkopf|['war']
I hate women because they always know where things are.|Voltaire|['women']
I have Social Disease. I have to go out every night. If I stay home one night I start spreading rumors to my dogs.|Andy Warhol|['home']
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.|Martin Luther King, Jr.|['equality']
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood.|Martin Luther King, Jr.|['equality']
I have a fantasy where Ted Turner is elected President but refuses because he doesn't want to give up power.|Arthur C. Clarke|['politics', 'power']
I have a fine sense of the ridiculous, but no sense of humor.|Edward Albee|['humor']
I have a great deal of company in the house, especially in the morning when nobody calls.|Henry David Thoreau|['great', 'morning']
I have a great love and respect for religion, great love and respect for atheism. What I hate is agnosticism, people who do not choose.|Orson Welles|['great', 'religion', 'respect']
I have a great mind to believe in Christianity for the mere pleasure of fancying I may be damned.|Lord Byron|['great']
I have a lot of sympathy for young people because I realize how disturbed I was. How would I deal with life in the future? What would I do for a living?|Clyde Tombaugh|['future', 'sympathy']
I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you can't get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That's in friendship, that's a deal, that's a commitment. Don't give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, that's for life.|Jerry Lewis|['friendship', 'life']
I have a new philosophy. I'm only going to dread one day at a time.|Charles M. Schulz|['funny', 'time']
I have a respect for manners as such, they are a way of dealing with people you don't agree with or like.|Margaret Mead|['respect']
I have a right to my anger, and I don't want anybody telling me I shouldn't be, that it's not nice to be, and that something's wrong with me because I get angry.|Maxine Waters|['anger']
I have a scheme for stopping war. It's this - no nation is allowed to enter a war till they have paid for the last one.|Will Rogers|['war']
I have a simple philosophy: Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. Scratch where it itches.|Alice Roosevelt Longworth|['life']
I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.|Hunter S. Thompson|['truth']
I have a total irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer.|Brendan Behan|['food', 'men', 'society', 'women']
I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it's apathy. It's not giving a damn.|Leo Buscaglia|['love']
I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my, or any, sense of right and wrong. I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.|Eliot Spitzer|['family']
I have actually five honorary degrees.|Katherine Dunham|['graduation']
I have always argued that change becomes stressful and overwhelming only when you've lost any sense of the constancy of your life. You need firm ground to stand on. From there, you can deal with that change.|Richard Nelson Bolles|['change', 'work']
I have always been amazed at the way an ordinary observer lends so much more credence and attaches so much more importance to waking events than to those occurring in dreams... Man... is above all the plaything of his memory.|Andre Breton|['dreams']
I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start, with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning.|J. B. Priestley|['morning']
I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.|Tennessee Williams|['failure', 'success', 'work']
I have always believed that 98% of a student's progress is due to his own efforts, and 2% to his teacher.|John Philip Sousa|['teacher']
I have always believed that I should have had no difficulty in causing my rights to be respected.|Eli Whitney|['respect']
I have always believed that it's important to show a new look periodically. Predictability can lead to failure.|T. Boone Pickens|['failure']
I have always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.|Hermann Hesse|['good']
I have always considered it as treason against the great republic of human nature, to make any man's virtues the means of deceiving him.|Samuel Johnson|['great', 'nature']
I have always detested any departure from reality, an attitude which I relate to my mother's poor mental health.|Jean Piaget|['attitude', 'health']
I have always felt that a woman has the right to treat the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm of over ninety. Then it is better she be candid with herself and with the world.|Carl Sandburg|['age']
I have always had a sense that we are all pretty much alone in life, particularly in adolescence.|Robert Cormier|['alone', 'teen']
I have always had a talent for irritating women since I was fourteen.|Marilyn Monroe|['women']
I have always had the courage for the new things that life sometimes offers.|Wallis Simpson|['courage']

I like getting married, but I don't like being married.|Don Adams|['marriage']

I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because, like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return.|Bertrand Russell|['god']

I like not only to be loved, but also to be told I am loved.|George Eliot|['love']

I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.|Mahatma Gandhi|['religion']

I live in a crazy time.|Anne Frank|['time']

I lived on the top of one hill and the school was at the top of another hill. Nobody ever went to school by car - we didn't have any cars during the war. So that to and from school was itself a training.|Roger Bannister|['car']

I never ask a man what his business is, for it never interests me. What I ask him about are his thoughts and dreams.|H. P. Lovecraft|['business', 'dreams']

I never called my work an 'art'. It's part of show business, the business of building entertainment.|Walt Disney|['art', 'business', 'work']

I admired this about him.|Jane Fonda|['family', 'movies']
I remember the 1940s as a time when we were united in a way known only to that generation. We belonged to a common cause-the war.|Gene Tierney|['war']

I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you don't even have to talk. You don't have to do anything but really be there with them.|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross|['love']
I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness.|Oscar Niemeyer|['architecture']
I see a bright future for the biotechnology industry when it follows the path of the computer industry, the path that von Neumann failed to foresee, becoming small and domesticated rather than big and centralized.|Freeman Dyson|['future']
I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.|Michael Graves|['architecture', 'poetry']
I see dance being used as communication between body and soul, to express what it too deep to find for words.|Ruth St. Denis|['communication']
I see great things in baseball. It's our game - the American game.|Walt Whitman|['great', 'sports']

I see heaven's glories shine and faith shines equal.|Emily Bronte|['faith']
I see humanity now as one vast plant, needing for its highest fulfillment only love, the natural blessings of the great outdoors, and intelligent crossing and selection.|Luther Burbank|['environmental', 'great']
I see no way out of the problems that organized religion and tribalism create other than humans just becoming more honest and fully aware of themselves.|E. O. Wilson|['religion']
I see nothing in space as promising as the view from a Ferris wheel.|E. B. White|['science']

I seek to call America home to those principles that gave us birth.|George McGovern|['home']
I seldom think about my limitations, and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers.|Helen Keller|['sad']
I served the famous professors and scholars, and eventually they learned that the Reverend Moon is superior to them. Even Nobel laureate academics who thought they were at the center of knowledge are as nothing in front of me.|Sun Myung Moon|['famous', 'knowledge']
I shall always respect the composer. If I embellish, it is his idea I am embellishing.|Kate Smith|['respect']
I shall be an autocrat, that's my trade and the good Lord will forgive me, that's his.|Catherine the Great|['forgiveness']
I shall begin my march for Camp tomorrow morning. It was not in my power to move until I could procure shoes for the troops almost barefoot.|Anthony Wayne|['morning']
I shall earnestly and persistently continue to urge all women to the practical recognition of the old Revolutionary maxim. Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.|Susan B. Anthony|['women']
I shall endeavour still further to prosecute this inquiry, an inquiry I trust not merely speculative, but of sufficient moment to inspire the pleasing hope of its becoming essentially beneficial to mankind.|Edward Jenner|['trust']
I shall give you hunger, and pain, and sleepless nights. Also beauty, and satisfactions known to few, and glimpses of the heavenly life. None of these you shall have continually, and of their coming and going you shall not be foretold.|Howard Lindsay|['beauty']
I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good.|Lucius Annaeus Seneca|['good']
I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.|Albert Einstein|['god']
I shall not change my course because those who assume to be better than I desire it.|Victoria Woodhull|['change']
I shall not die of a cold. I shall die of having lived.|Willa Cather|['death']
I shall not grow conservative with age.|Elizabeth Cady Stanton|['age']
I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.|Karl Von Clausewitz|['war']
I shall soon be six-and-twenty. Is there anything in the future that can possibly console us for not being always twenty-five?|George Byron|['future']
I shall suggest, on the contrary, that all communication relies, to a noticeable extent on evoking knowledge that we cannot tell, and that all our knowledge of mental processes, like feelings or conscious intellectual activities, is based on a knowledge which we cannot tell.|Michael Polanyi|['communication', 'knowledge']
I shall the effect of this good lesson keeps as watchman to my heart.|William Shakespeare|['good']
I share the opinion of those of broader vision, who see in the signs of the time hope of humanity for peace.|Frank B. Kellogg|['peace']
I should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first.|Benjamin Franklin|['life']
I should like to know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out.|George Eliot|['home', 'women']
I should like to suggest to you that the cause of all the economic troubles is that we have an economic system which tries to maintain an equality of value between two things, which it would be better to recognise from the beginning as of unequal value.|Paul Dirac|['equality']
I showed that privacy was an implicit right in Jewish law, probably going back to the second or third century, when it was elaborated on in a legal way.|Norman Lamm|['legal']
I simply can't build my hopes on a foundation of confusion, misery and death... I think... peace and tranquillity will return again.|Anne Frank|['death', 'hope', 'peace']
I simply do not distinguish between work and play.|Mary Oliver|['work']
I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse. I only owe it to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|['nature']
I slept and dreamt that life was beauty I woke and found that life was duty.|George Byron|['beauty']
I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.|Rabindranath Tagore|['life']

I smoke ten to fifteen cigars a day. At my age I have to hold on to something.|George Burns|['age']
I sometimes get that wonderful sympathy between me and the audience, telling me I've reached their hearts. And when I do, the thrill is mine.|Kate Smith|['sympathy']
I sometimes have a horrible fear of turning up a canvas of mine. I'm always afraid of finding a monster in place of the precious jewels I thought I had put there!|Camille Pissarro|['fear']
I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.|Oscar Wilde|['god']
I sort of understood that when I first started: that you shouldn't repeat a success. Very often you're going to, and maybe the first time you do, it works. And you love it. But then you're trapped.|Jack Nicholson|['success']
I sort of was good at writing essays. I was never very good at mathematics, and I was never very good at algebra. I loved science, but I wasn't sure of it.|Diane Cilento|['science']
I sought Ben Affleck because I needed an everyman for this role. Ben appeals to men and women. He gives you a sense of intelligence, the notion of a guy who can think on his feet.|John Frankenheimer|['intelligence']
I speak relatively little, except when I'm at home and I'm asking for things.|Roger Moore|['home']
I speak the truth not so much as I would, but as much as I dare, and I dare a little more as I grow older.|Michel de Montaigne|['truth']
I spend my afternoons painting and working on my Open Hearts jewelry line for Kay Jewelers. I designed an image of a heart that isn't completely closed. My mom always told me to live with an open heart - when life gets tough, you should go out and help someone else.|Jane Seymour|['mom']
I spend my happiest hours in reading Vedantic books. They are to me like the light of the morning, like the pure air of the mountains - so simple, so true, if once understood.|Max Muller|['morning']
I spent a great deal of time with Che Guevara while I was in Havana. I believe he was far less a mercenary than he was a freedom fighter.|Maureen O'Hara|['freedom']
I spent a lot of time in the school psychologist's office. I didn't apply myself. My mother thought I had learning disabilities.|Roger Goodell|['learning']
I spent a year in that town, one Sunday.|George Burns|['funny']
I spent many a summer early morning with the radio very low, half sleeping and half listening.|Frankie Valli|['morning']
I spent some time at White Memorial Medical Center as a senior medical student doing a rotation in surgery however, I felt I wasn't getting enough time assisting.|Samuel Wilson|['medical']
I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library, and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money. At the end of 10 years, I had read every book in the library and I'd written a thousand stories.|Ray Bradbury|['education', 'money']
I spoke without fear of contradiction. I simply did not suffer self-doubt.|Elia Kazan|['fear']
I stand before you today because this vision of government as the engine of opportunity is what I believe in.|Eliot Spitzer|['government']
I stand fearlessly for small dogs, the American Flag, motherhood and the Bible. That's why people love me.|Art Linkletter|['mom']
I started in this racket in the early '70s, and when I was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, of which I was like the sixth president, I was the first one nobody ever heard of.|Jerry Pournelle|['science']
I started on the use of the Internet for scientific communication. Our research group was one of the very first to make really systematic use of it as a way of managing research projects.|Joshua Lederberg|['communication']
I stayed away from mathematics not so much because I knew it would be hard work as because of the amount of time I knew it would take, hours spent in a field where I was not a natural.|Carl Sandburg|['work']
I stayed in show business to pay for my animal business.|Betty White|['business']
I still believe that if your aim is to change the world, journalism is a more immediate short-term weapon.|Tom Stoppard|['change']

I still have a young attitude.|Pat Morita|['attitude']
I still work out on a daily basis.|Clint Eastwood|['work']
I stone got crazy when I saw somebody run down them strings with a bottleneck. My eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and I said that I had to learn.|Muddy Waters|['christmas']
I stood up as best I could to their disgusting stupidity and brutality, but I did not, of course, manage to beat them at their own game. It was a fight to the bitter end, one in which I was not defending ideals or beliefs but simply my own self.|George Grosz|['best']
I stopped and gazed on the little dull man who was being paid to be a teacher of teachers. I turned and walked to the door, slammed it closed with a bang, and broken glass crashed to the floor. There was uproar behind me in the class, which did not interest me at all.|Burl Ives|['teacher']
I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was six. Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph.|Shirley Temple|['christmas']
I stopped loving my father a long time ago. What remained was the slavery to a pattern.|Anais Nin|['dad', 'time']
I submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law.|Martin Luther King, Jr.|['respect']
I suddenly realized how much I loved her when we attended Alfred Hitchcock's 75th birthday party last August. There was something magical about that night, and it made me see how much she really meant to me.|Rod Taylor|['birthday']
I suffered, I really suffered, with all three of my husbands. And I tried damn hard with all three, starting each marriage certain that it was going to last until the end of my life. Yet none of them lasted more than a year or two.|Ava Gardner|['marriage']
I support legal immigration.|Heather Wilson|['legal']
I support legal immigration. I don't support amnesty because it is not fair to people standing in line at consulates around the world.|Heather Wilson|['legal']
I suppose I have a really loose interpretation of 'work,' because I think that just being alive is so much work at something you don't always want to do. The machinery is always going. Even when you sleep.|Andy Warhol|['work']
I suppose I was a little bit of what would be called today a nerd. I didn't have girlfriends, and really I wasn't a very social boy.|Charles Kuralt|['dating']
I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles but today it means getting along with people.|Mahatma Gandhi|['leadership', 'time']
I suppose society is wonderfully delightful. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it is simply a tragedy.|Oscar Wilde|['society']
I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up. It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.|Elizabeth Taylor|['age', 'men']
I suppose, in a way, this has become part of my soul. It is a symbol of my life. Whatever I have done that really matters, I've done wearing it. When the time comes, it will be in this that I journey forth. What greater honor could come to an American, and a soldier?|Douglas MacArthur|['time']
I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyer belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.|Elvis Presley|['movies']
I surrendered to a world of my imagination, reenacting all those wonderful tales my father would read aloud to me. I became a very active reader, especially history and Shakespeare.|Andrew Wyeth|['imagination']

I take it that what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some formula of peace.|Joseph Conrad|['peace']
I take my children everywhere, but they always find their way back home.|Robert Orben|['home', 'parenting']
I talk to women's groups all over the country and see women struggling with this. The fear of not being accepted, of being different, of not having a man, all make it hard for a woman to do what she really believes is right for her.|Olympia Dukakis|['fear']
I talked to the players and tried to make them aware of what was good and bad, but I didn't try to run their lives.|John Wooden|['good']
I taught in a small teacher's college for three or four years, at which point all the administrators got a pay raise and the teaching faculty didn't.|David Eddings|['teacher']
I tell my students, it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see, who's very far away, who's a different color, who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.|Chinua Achebe|['food']
I tell myself that God gave my children many gifts - spirit, beauty, intelligence, the capacity to make friends and to inspire respect. There was only one gift he held back - length of life.|Rose Kennedy|['beauty', 'god', 'intelligence', 'respect']
I tell you in truth: all men are Prophets or else God does not exist.|Jean-Paul Sartre|['god', 'truth']
I tell you the past is a bucket of ashes, so live not in your yesterdays, no just for tomorrow, but in the here and now. Keep moving and forget the post mortems and remember, no one can get the jump on the future.|Carl Sandburg|['future', 'movingon']
I tend to head for what's amusing because a lot of things aren't happy. But usually you can find a funny side to practically anything.|Maggie Smith|['funny']
I thank my God for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|['death', 'god', 'happiness', 'learning']
I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes.|e. e. cummings|['amazing', 'god', 'nature']
I therefore declare, that if you wish any remission of the taxation which falls upon the homes of the people of England and Wales, you can only find it by reducing the great military establishments, and diminishing the money paid to fighting men in time of peace.|Richard Cobden|['peace']
I think ABBA have a pure joy to their music and that's what makes them extraordinary.|Bono|['music']
I think Captain Cousteau might be the father of the environmental movement.|Ted Turner|['environmental']
I think Gingrich has embarrassed the party over time. Whether he'll do it again in the future, I don't know. But Gov. Romney never has.|Chris Christie|['future']
I think God made a woman to be strong and not to be trampled under the feet of men. I've always felt this way because my mother was a very strong woman, without a husband.|Little Richard|['god', 'men', 'women']
I think I finally chose the graduate degree in engineering primarily because it only took one year and law school took three years, and I felt the pressure of being a little behind - although I was just 22.|Daniel J. Evans|['graduation']
I think I have always had a little humor.|Marilyn Monroe|['humor']
I think I have more patience now than I did in the past.|T. Boone Pickens|['patience']
I think I thought it would be important for electronics as we knew it then, but that was a much simpler business and electronics was mostly radio and television and the first computers.|Jack Kilby|['business', 'computers']
I think I was a good student, because I jumped over a school. My main interest was basically history and literature. Sports were basically basketball and swimming at a pool. I was so happy.|Shimon Peres|['history', 'sports']
I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.|Diane Wakoski|['poetry']
I think I'm basically the same guy I always was. Maybe I've learned, through experience, to rein in some of the anger and temper they say redheads normally have.|Willie Nelson|['anger', 'experience']
I think I'm finally growing up - and about time.|Elizabeth Taylor|['time']
I think I'm in a business where you have to look good, and it's totally youth-oriented.|Joan Rivers|['business']
I think I've discovered the secret of life - you just hang around until you get used to it.|Charles M. Schulz|['life']
I think Lenat is headed in the right direction, but someone needs to include a knowledge base about learning.|Marvin Minsky|['knowledge', 'learning']
I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone.|Flip Wilson|['alone']
I think Muslims have become the new Negroes in America. They are being mistreated at airports, by the Immigration - everywhere. Islam is a religion of peace. They are wrong.|Jermaine Jackson|['peace', 'religion']
I think President Obama could have handled politics and policies differently. But he has been decisive, strong, and consistent - important qualities in a president. Mitt Romney is indeed an Etch A Sketch, the antithesis of leadership.|Eliot Spitzer|['leadership', 'politics']
I think Ray Charles did as much as anybody when he did his country music album. Ray Charles broke down borders and showed the similarities between country music and R&ampB.|Willie Nelson|['music']
I think a child should be allowed to take his father's or mother's name at will on coming of age. Paternity is a legal fiction.|James Joyce|['age', 'legal']
I think a lot of people get so obsessed with the wedding and the expense of the wedding that they miss out on what the real purpose is. It's not about a production number, it's about a meaningful moment between two people that's witnessed by people that they actually really know and care about.|Jane Seymour|['wedding']
I think a lot of people, even Christians, are willing to be satisfied with gaining lots and lots of biblical knowledge - and many people go to Bible studies and don't realize it isn't enough to know what's right, it's applying the information and the knowledge that you have.|Charles Stanley|['knowledge']
I think a major element of jetlag is psychological. Nobody ever tells me what time it is at home.|David Attenborough|['home', 'travel']
I think about baseball when I wake up in the morning. I think about it all day and I dream about it at night. The only time I don't think about it is when I'm playing it.|Carl Yastrzemski|['morning', 'time']
I think age is a very high price to pay for maturity.|Tom Stoppard|['age']
I think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88% chance of mission success and maybe 96% chance of survival. And we were willing to take those odds.|Alan Shepard|['success']
I think all those people I did stories about measured their own success by the joy their work was giving them.|Charles Kuralt|['success']
I think an artist has always to be out of step with his time.|Orson Welles|['time']
I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.|Albert Einstein|['time']
I think any man in business would be foolish to fool around with his secretary. If it's somebody else's secretary, fine.|Barry Goldwater|['business']
I think anybody with any intelligence sits down and sees Star Trek not a kids' show.|Nichelle Nichols|['intelligence']
I think being able to age gracefully is a very important talent. It is too late for me.|Clint Eastwood|['age']
I think being funny is not anyone's first choice.|Woody Allen|['funny']
I think careful cooking is love, don't you? The loveliest thing you can cook for someone who's close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give.|Julia Child|['love']
I think every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass.|Barry Goldwater|['good']
I think everyone should experience defeat at least once during their career. You learn a lot from it.|Lou Holtz|['experience']
I think everyone should go to college and get a degree and then spend six months as a bartender and six months as a cabdriver. Then they would really be educated.|Al McGuire|['education']
I think everything depends on money.|Alan Bean|['money']
I think government has a major role to play in helping us with the pursuit of happiness.|William Weld|['happiness']
I think having land and not ruining it is the most beautiful art that anybody could ever want to own.|Andy Warhol|['art']
I think he Oswald felt he was a failure and for the United States and for President Kennedy and all of us. He knew he was a failure at everything he tried, frustrated, with a very sad life, but he was a Marxist.|John Sherman Cooper|['failure', 'sad']
I think health is another exceedingly important thing.|Joan Collins|['health']
I think if I'm going to do a science fiction, I'm going to go down a new path that I want to do.|Ridley Scott|['science']
I think if there's a great depression there might be some hope.|Lawrence Ferlinghetti|['hope']
I think it better that in times like these a poet's mouth be silent, for in truth we have no gift to set a statesman right.|William Butler Yeats|['truth']
I think it has other roots, has to do, in part, with a general anxiety in contemporary life... nuclear bombs, inequality of possibility and chance, inequality of goods allotted to us, a kind of general racist, unjust attitude that is pervasive.|Leonard Baskin|['attitude']
I think it has something to do with being British. We don't take ourselves as seriously as some other countries do. I think a lot of people take themselves far too seriously I find that a very tedious attitude.|Joan Collins|['attitude']
I think it is important that we rebuild an atmosphere of forgiveness and civility in every aspect of our lives.|T. D. Jakes|['forgiveness']
I think it is important to ask ourselves as citizens, not as Democrats attacking the administration, but as citizens, whether a world power can really provide global leadership on the basis of fear and anxiety?|Zbigniew Brzezinski|['fear', 'leadership']
I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.|Alan Perlis|['technology']
I think it was my study of history that convinced me that the Democratic Party was more on the side of the average American.|George McGovern|['history']
I think it will be found that experience, the true source and foundation of all knowledge, invariably confirms its truth.|Thomas Malthus|['knowledge']
I think it's a mistake to ever look for hope outside of one's self.|Arthur Miller|['hope']
I think it's a terrible thing to write and not enjoy it. It's a sad thing. But of course a lot of people do work because they need to eat. And we all need to eat, but that's not the only reason to work. You couldn't have paid me not to write.|Anne Perry|['sad']
I think it's horrible that people have to be told. Don't smoke! Everybody knows it's bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.|Karl Lagerfeld|['health']
I think it's my adventure, my trip, my journey, and I guess my attitude is, let the chips fall where they may.|Leonard Nimoy|['attitude']
I think it's realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: 'I despair. The world's no good.' That's a perverse idealist. It's practical to hope, because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That's very realistic.|Studs Terkel|['hope']
I think it's so funny when people think they can't control a movie star. They can. We're just women, you know.|Esther Williams|['funny']
I think it's your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that's a waste of a lovely life. 'Oh... I'm 30, oh, I'm 40, oh, 50.' Make the most of it.|Betty White|['age', 'attitude']
I think kids slowly begin to realize that what they're learning relates to other things they know. Then learning starts to get more and more exciting.|Norton Juster|['learning']
I think life is sort of like a competition, whether it's in sports, or it's achieving in school, or it's achieving good relationships with people. And competition is a little bit of what it's all about.|Sanford I. Weill|['sports']
I think love and beauty are what life is all about.|John Derek|['beauty']
I think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it... The man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on.|Samuel Goldwyn|['smile']
I think making mistakes and discovering them for yourself is of great value, but to have someone else to point out your mistakes is a shortcut of the process.|Shelby Foote|['great']
I think men are afraid to be with a successful woman, because we are terribly strong, we know what we want and we are not fragile enough.|Shirley Bassey|['men']
I think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage. They've experienced pain and bought jewelry.|Rita Rudner|['marriage']
I think mistakes are the essence of science and law. It's impossible to conceive of either scientific progress or legal progress without understanding the important role of being wrong and of mistakes.|Alan Dershowitz|['legal', 'science']
I think money in general hurts all sports.|Will McDonough|['sports']
I think money is essential to happiness and right now I wouldn't want to be anyone other than Wilbur Smith - I've had a fantastic life, rewarded far more heavily than I deserve. Maybe I'd like to be J. K. Rowling, but I'll settle for second best.|Wilbur Smith|['happiness']
I think more and more people want to live alone. You can be a couple without being in each other's pockets. I don't see why you have to share the same bathroom.|Jeanne Moreau|['alone']
I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times.|Willie Nelson|['art']
I think most of the people involved in any art always secretly wonder whether they are really there because they're good or there because they're lucky.|Katharine Hepburn|['art', 'good']
I think my father would have liked to have been an artist, actually. But I think he didn't quite have perhaps the drive or, I don't know, I mean he had a family to bring up I suppose.|David Hockney|['family']
I think my parents were happy that I'd gone to university and gotten a degree in history so they thought, 'Well if acting doesn't work for him, he can always become a history teacher or something.' Fortunately, the acting worked out.|Derek Jacobi|['teacher']
I think of art as the highest level of creativity. To me, it is one of the greatest sources of enjoyment.|David Rockefeller|['art']
I think of doing a series as very hard work. But then I've talked to coal miners, and that's really hard work.|William Shatner|['work']
I think older women still have a full life.|Betty White|['women']
I think on-stage nudity is disgusting, shameful and damaging to all things American. But if I were 22 with a great body, it would be artistic, tasteful, patriotic and a progressive religious experience.|Shelley Winters|['experience']
I think one of the basic reasons men make good friends is that they can make up their minds quickly.|Marilyn Monroe|['good', 'men']
I think one of the terrible things today is that people have this deathly fear of food: fear of eggs, say, or fear of butter. Most doctors feel that you can have a little bit of everything.|Julia Child|['fear', 'food']
I think one of the things that language poets are very involved with is getting away from conventional ideas of beauty, because those ideas contain a certain attitude toward women, certain attitudes toward sex, certain attitudes toward race, etc.|Diane Wakoski|['attitude', 'beauty']
I think one reason for a successful marriage is laughter. I think laughter gets you through the rough moments in a marriage.|Bob Newhart|['marriage']
I think our failure in the production of good town churches of distinctive character must have struck you often, as it has me, when contrasted with our comparative success in country churches.|George Edmund Street|['failure']
I think peace should be done not only among governments but among people. It was impossible before the Facebook.|Shimon Peres|['peace']
I think people need to be educated to the fact that marijuana is not a drug. Marijuana is an herb and a flower. God put it here. If He put it here and He wants it to grow, what gives the government the right to say that God is wrong?|Willie Nelson|['god', 'government']
I think people really marry far too much it is such a lottery after all, and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness.|Queen Victoria|['happiness']
I think people should be allowed to do anything they want. We haven't tried that for a while. Maybe this time it'll work.|George Carlin|['time', 'work']
I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.|Nancy Reagan|['death']
I think permitting the game to become too physical takes away a little bit of the beauty.|John Wooden|['beauty']
I think space will be conquered through the mind rather than the clumsy medium of space travel.|Patrick Troughton|['travel']
I think that God, in creating man, somewhat overestimated his ability.|Oscar Wilde|['god']
I think that NATO is itself a war criminal.|Harold Pinter|['war']
I think that New York is not the cultural centre of America, but the business and administrative centre of American culture.|Saul Bellow|['business']
I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you're in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.|Bob Barker|['age', 'health']
I think that anything that begins to give people a sense of their own worth and dignity is God.|John Shelby Spong|['god']
I think that economic patriotism is the very foundation of a European vision.|Dominique de Villepin|['patriotism']
I think that everybody in the world, whatever colour or creed, has a jerk like JR in his or her family somewhere. Whether it is a father, uncle, cousin or brother, everybody can identify with JR and that certainly had something to do with the success of 'Dallas.'|Larry Hagman|['success']
I think that everything you do helps you to write if you're a writer. Adversity and success both contribute largely to making you what you are. If you don't experience either one of those, you're being deprived of something.|Shelby Foote|['success']
I think that great poetry is the most interesting and complex use of the poet's language at that point in history, and so it's even more exciting when you read a poet like Yeats, almost 100 years old now, and you think that perhaps no one can really top that.|Diane Wakoski|['poetry']
I think that it's always appropriate for Americans and for American foreign policy to make clear why we feel that self-government is most compatible with peace, the well-being of people, and human dignity.|Jeane Kirkpatrick|['peace']
I think that lawyers are terrible at admitting that they're wrong. And not just admitting it also realizing it. Most lawyers are very successful, and they think that because they're making money and people think well of them, they must be doing everything right.|Alan Dershowitz|['money']
I think that making love is the best form of exercise.|Cary Grant|['best']
I think that maybe if women and children were in charge we would get somewhere.|James Thurber|['women']
I think that money spoils most things, once it becomes the primary motivating force.|John Cleese|['money']
I think that my preaching style and many of my ideas and ideals about faith are based in both Pentecostal and Baptist background.|T. D. Jakes|['faith']
I think that one possible definition of our modern culture is that it is one in which nine-tenths of our intellectuals can't read any poetry.|Randall Jarrell|['poetry']
I think that one's art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows.|Emily Carr|['art']
I think that the U.S. does have this very much more open attitude, and I admire it very much and I think it's very important to the world. But the information and the discussion sometimes come too late, after the effective decision has been made.|E. P. Thompson|['attitude']
I think that the best way to explain that is that my mother gave me all the color and character and flare and liveliness, and my father gave me all the sanity and nature and all the things that helped me be a more rounded human being.|Julie Andrews|['nature']
I think that the core doctrines of Christianity - the incarnation, the resurrection, life after death-these are as strong as ever. In fact, the belief in life after death has increased in this century.|Andrew Greeley|['death']
I think that the present is worth attention, one shouldn't sacrifice it to future conceptions of, of this future or that future.|Tom Stoppard|['future']
I think that the proposed constitution is one of the European legal documents with the strongest social dimension I have seen since I began following European issues.|Jean-Pierre Raffarin|['legal']
I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.|Henry David Thoreau|['business', 'life', 'poetry']
I think that this is the first war in history that on the morrow the victors sued for peace and the vanquished called for unconditional surrender.|Abba Eban|['peace']
I think that to a very great extent we are partners with the divine in this enterprise called history. That is an ongoing relationship, and there is absolutely no guarantee that things will automatically work out to our best advantage.|Chaim Potok|['relationship']
I think that we had a different view of what the 21st century could be like, with much more of a sense, from our perspective, of trying to have an interdependent world: looking at solving regional conflicts, having strength in alliances, operating within some kind of a sense that we were part of the international community and not outside of it.|Madeleine Albright|['strength']
I think that what I'm doing is right. And election-year politics, which intensifies everything, is not going to drive me off that course.|Eric Holder|['politics']
I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated.|Marilyn Monroe|['famous']
I think that's one of the most difficult things in any marriage - in order to build anything, you must be together. You can't build anything over the telephone.|Julie London|['marriage']
I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device, It's just about a human being.|Jack Nicholson|['movies', 'science']
I think that's what poetry does. It allows people to come together and identify with a common thing that is outside of themselves, but which they identify with from the interior.|Diane Wakoski|['poetry']
I think the American Dream says that anything can happen if you work hard enough at it and are persistent, and have some ability. The sky is the limit to what you can build, and what can happen to you and your family.|Sanford I. Weill|['family', 'work']
I think the American government is now the most corrupt government in the world.|Ginger Baker|['government']
I think the Democrats are catering to them, but, you know, in the entire history of the United States of America, there has never been a judge who has been refused a vote when there was a majority of Senators willing to vote for his confirmation, never in history.|Pat Robertson|['history']
I think the International Criminal Court could be a threat to American security interests, because the prosecutor of the court has enormous discretion in going after war crimes. And the way the Statute of Rome is written, responsibility for war crimes can be taken all the way up the chain of command.|John Bolton|['war']
I think the Moslem faith teaches hate.|Jerry Falwell|['faith']
I think the amazing thing about gospel music is that not only does it lift up the death and resurrection of our Lord, which is consistent with the Gospel, but it is uniquely communicated depending upon the generation.|T. D. Jakes|['amazing', 'death']
I think the country's getting disgusted with Washington partly because of the decline of civility in government.|George McGovern|['government']
I think the driving thing was curiosity about the universe. That fascinated me. I didn't think anything about being famous or anything like that, I was just interested in the concepts involved.|Clyde Tombaugh|['famous']
I think the drummer should sit back there and play some drums, and never mind about the tunes. Just get up there and wail behind whoever is sitting up there playing the solo. And this is what is lacking, definitely lacking in music today.|Buddy Rich|['music']
I think the environment should be put in the category of our national security. Defense of our resources is just as important as defense abroad. Otherwise what is there to defend?|Robert Redford|['environmental']
I think the first duty of society is justice.|Alexander Hamilton|['society']
I think the first step is to understand that forgiveness does not exonerate the perpetrator. Forgiveness liberates the victim. It's a gift you give yourself.|T. D. Jakes|['forgiveness']
I think the future of psychotherapy and psychology is in the school system. We need to teach every child how to rarely seriously disturb himself or herself and how to overcome disturbance when it occurs.|Albert Ellis|['future']
I think the greater responsibility, in terms of morality, is where leadership begins.|Norman Lear|['leadership']
I think the one thing this picture shows that's new is the psychological disproportion of the kids' demands on the parents. Parents are often at fault, but the kids have some work to do, too.|James Dean|['work']
I think the part of media that romanticizes criminal behavior, things that a person will say against women, profanity, being gangster, having multiple children with multiple men and women and not wanting to is prevalent. When you look at the majority of shows on television they placate that kind of behavior.|Bill Cosby|['men', 'women']
I think the pattern of my essays is, A funny thing happened to me on my way through Finnegans Wake.|Leslie Fiedler|['funny']
I think the perception of there being a deep gulf between science and the humanities is false.|Clifford Geertz|['science']
I think the person who takes a job in order to live - that is to say, for the money - has turned himself into a slave.|Joseph Campbell|['money', 'work']
I think the personal relationships I established mattered in terms of what I was able to get done. And I did bring women's issues to the center of our foreign policy.|Madeleine Albright|['women']
I think the real problem for American religion are those minority of fundamentalists who try to identify political policies with religion.|Andrew Greeley|['religion']
I think the reason people are dealing with science less well now than 50 years ago is that it has become so complicated.|James D. Watson|['science']
I think the state of the NFL has a very positive outlook.|Roger Goodell|['positive']
I think the teaching profession contributes more to the future of our society than any other single profession.|John Wooden|['future', 'society']
I think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work. When he looks back over the body of his work and he's written poetry then let the verdict be that he's a poet.|Leonard Cohen|['poetry']
I think there are a lot of people who really want to be famous, they really do. I don't. It sort of gets in the way of the everyday things that I do.|Johnny Mathis|['famous']
I think there has been a great deal of valuable revisionism in women's history.|Antonia Fraser|['history']
I think there is one higher office than president and I would call that patriot.|Gary Hart|['politics']
I think there ought to be a club in which preachers and journalists could come together and have the sentimentalism of the one matched with the cynicism of the other. That ought to bring them pretty close to the truth.|Reinhold Niebuhr|['truth']
I think there's a supreme power behind the whole thing, an intelligence. Look at all of the instincts of nature, both animals and plants, the very ingenious ways they survive. If you cut yourself, you don't have to think about it.|Clyde Tombaugh|['intelligence', 'nature']
I think there's a tremendous split between people who've been through a war and people who haven't.|Antonia Fraser|['war']
I think there's not much patience for organized labour, period, public or private sector.|Kathleen Wynne|['patience']
I think they quite like me when I work because I'm one of the safer directors to back, because even if my films don't bring their costs in back home, once they're shown outside of India they manage to cover the costs.|Satyajit Ray|['home']
I think through education, belief in God, and good engineering, our children become a lot better at what they're doing than we did, and that starts with the very first sign of life on the face of this earth.|Evel Knievel|['education']
I think we are a product of all our experiences.|Sanford I. Weill|['experience']
I think we can allow the therapeutic uses of nuclear transplant technology, which we call cloning, without running the danger of actually having live human beings born.|David Baltimore|['technology']
I think we consider too much the good luck of the early bird and not enough the bad luck of the early worm.|Franklin D. Roosevelt|['good']
I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.|Neil Armstrong|['nature']
I think what coaching is all about, is taking players and analyzing there ability, put them in a position where they can excel within the framework of the team winning. And I hope that I've done that in my 33 years as a head coach.|Don Shula|['hope']
I think what he's - what he believes, and he may be correct, I don't know, that we have some intelligence information that leads us to know some things about what's going on in Iraq that we haven't revealed to others.|Lawrence Eagleburger|['intelligence']
I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don't interfere in your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.|Michael Caine|['home']
I think what weakens people most is fear of wasting their strength.|Etty Hillesum|['fear', 'strength']
I think when someone is injured in your family, you want to speak to the individual and you want to hear their voice and you want to make sure they are OK.|Roger Goodell|['family']
I think when the full horror of being fifty hits you, you should stay home and have a good cry.|Josh Billings|['age', 'home']
I think when you begin to think of yourself as having achieved something, then there's nothing left for you to work towards. I want to believe that there is a mountain so high that I will spend my entire life striving to reach the top of it.|Cicely Tyson|['work']
I think whether you're having setbacks or not, the role of a leader is to always display a winning attitude.|Colin Powell|['attitude']
I think women are concerned too much with their clothes. Men don't really care that much about women's clothes. If they like a girl, chances are they'll like her clothes.|Hedy Lamarr|['women']
I think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking. Men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends. That's a gross generalization, but I think it holds in many ways.|Madeleine Albright|['women']
I think women want to take care of themselves, and I think having a voice in how that is done is very important.|Madeleine Albright|['women']
I think you can be cynical about religion on occasion, and certainly skeptical about the degree to which some people use religion to manipulate other people.|Peter Jennings|['religion']
I think your alcohol intake has to change. You know, usually a big person feels they can drink anything they want to and as much as they want to and I've cut that way back.|Mike Ditka|['change']
I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.|Lauren Bacall|['age']
I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift should be curiosity.|Eleanor Roosevelt|['birthday']
I think, however, that so long as our present economic and national systems continue, scientific research has little to fear.|John B. S. Haldane|['fear']
I thought I should go to New York because it was the place to go to study. I went and tried to get an application from the Juilliard School but they wouldn't even give me one because I didn't have my high school graduation.|Maureen Forrester|['graduation']
I thought I was benefiting the Indians as well as the government, by taking them all over the United States, and giving them a correct idea of the customs, life, etc., of the pale faces, so that when they returned to their people they could make known all they had seen.|Buffalo Bill|['government']
I thought I was going to be killed. The casualties were so heavy, it was just a given. I learned to take each day, each mission, as it came. That's an attitude I've carried into my professional life. I take each case, each job, as it comes.|Elliot Richardson|['attitude']
I thought I was learning about show business. The more painful it was, the more important I thought the experience must be. Hating it, I convinced myself it must be invaluable.|Judy Holliday|['learning']
I thought my life was mapped out. Research, living in the forest, teaching and writing. But in '86 I went to a conference and realised the chimpanzees were disappearing. I had worldwide recognition and a gift of communication. I had to use them.|Jane Goodall|['communication']
I thought of Paris as a beauty spot on the face of the earth, and of London as a big freckle.|James Weldon Johnson|['beauty']
I thought perhaps it should be recognized that religious people, including fundamentalists, are quite intelligent, many of them are highly educated, and they should be treated with complete respect.|E. O. Wilson|['respect']
I thought the Vietnam war was an utter, unmitigated disaster, so it was very hard for me to say anything good about it.|George McGovern|['war']
I thought we were gonna open up the world of poetry and music to all kinds of things, and yet, I can't really think of anyone who's done anything like it since.|Ray Manzarek|['poetry']
I told my doctor I get very tired when I go on a diet, so he gave me pep pills. Know what happened? I ate faster.|Joe E. Lewis|['diet']
I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist. Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two plumbers, and a bartender.|Rodney Dangerfield|['truth']
I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.|Joseph Smith, Jr.|['god', 'religion']
I took a speed-reading course and read War and Peace in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.|Woody Allen|['peace', 'war']
I took every chance I could to meet with U.S. soldiers. I talked with them and read the books they gave me about the war. I decided I needed to return to my country and join with them - active duty soldiers and Vietnam Veterans in particular - to try and end the war.|Jane Fonda|['war']
I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me.|Simone de Beauvoir|['love', 'truth']
I travel all over the country making speeches for people I believe in.|Ann Richards|['travel']
I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move.|Robert Louis Stevenson|['great', 'travel']
I travel the world, and I'm happy to say that America is still the great melting pot - maybe a chunky stew rather than a melting pot at this point, but you know what I mean.|Philip Glass|['travel']
I tread in the footsteps of illustrious men... in receiving from the people the sacred trust confided to my illustrious predecessor.|Martin Van Buren|['trust']
I tremble for my country when I hear of confidence expressed in me. I know too well my weakness, that our only hope is in God.|Robert E. Lee|['god', 'hope']
I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just that his justice cannot sleep forever.|Thomas Jefferson|['god']
I tried for a while to be an agricultural worker and was hopelessly bored. I would stand around in heaps of manure and sing about the beauty of the work I wasn't doing.|Theodore Bikel|['beauty']
I tried for a while to be an agricultural worker and was hopelessly bored. To me it was meaningless. I would stand around in heaps of manure and sings about the beauty of the work I wasn't doing.|Theodore Bikel|['beauty']
I tried to drown my sorrows, but the bastards learned how to swim, and now I am overwhelmed by this decent and good feeling.|Frida Kahlo|['good']
I tried to stir the imagination and enthusiasms of students to take risks, to do what they were most afraid of doing, to widen their horizons of action.|James Broughton|['imagination']
I trust Winsor and Newton and I paint directly upon it.|Edward Hopper|['trust']
I trust in God, and His ways are not our ways. So we have to go with that, and there's nothing I can do about that.|Cissy Houston|['trust']
I trust in nature for the stable laws of beauty and utility. Spring shall plant and autumn garner to the end of time.|Robert Browning|['beauty', 'trust']
I trust it will not be giving away professional secrets to say that many readers would be surprised, perhaps shocked, at the questions which some newspaper editors will put to a defenseless woman under the guise of flattery.|Kate Chopin|['trust']
I trust myself. You need that to survive.|Yoko Ono|['trust']
I trust no one, not even myself.|Joseph Stalin|['trust']
I try to act out of faith.|Marian Wright Edelman|['faith']
I try to decorate my imagination as much as I can.|Franz Schubert|['imagination']

I try to help people realize their dreams by using magic to tell stories that educate, move, and inspire.|David Copperfield|['dreams']
I turned down 'Some Like It Hot.' See how smart I am? I felt I couldn't bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don't need to compete with the wardrobe.|Jerry Lewis|['funny']
I turned into a workaholic to the point of where my health was in jeopardy.|Tab Hunter|['health']
I understand by this passion the union of desire, friendship, and tenderness, which is inflamed by a single female, which prefers her to the rest of her sex, and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being.|Edward Gibbon|['friendship', 'happiness']
I understand that in these difficult economic times, the potential for any additional expense is not welcomed by American businesses. But in the long run, the health insurance reform law promises to cut health-care costs for U.S. businesses, not expand them.|Gary Locke|['health']
I understand the Second Amendment. I respect the Second Amendment. I think we need to use common sense tools to keep the American people safe, to keep our streets safe.|Eric Holder|['respect']
I use a lot of film images, analogies, and imagination.|Carlos Fuentes|['imagination']
I used to be Snow White, but I drifted.|Mae West|['funny']
I used to be a Catholic. I left because I object to conversion by concussion. If you don't agree with what they teach, you get clobbered over the head until you do. All that does is change the shape of the head.|Alan Alda|['change']
I used to be a discipline problem, which caused me embarrassment until I realized that being a discipline problem in a racist society is sometimes an honor.|Ishmael Reed|['society']
I used to do this as a kid. And now they're paying me for it, which is cool.|William Kempe|['cool']
I used to get criticized for putting food in novels.|Jim Harrison|['food']
I used to go down every year for the remembrance of Elvis' birthday. Memphis State College invited me to sit in the auditorium and speak to the people for one of those Elvis days.|Otis Blackwell|['birthday']
I used to lie between cool, clean sheets at night after I'd had a bath, after I had washed my hair and scrubbed my knuckles and finger-nails and teeth. Then I could lie quite still in the dark with my face to the window with the trees in it, and talk to God.|Frances Farmer|['cool']
I used to read five psalms every day - that teaches me how to get along with God. Then I read a chapter of Proverbs every day and that teaches me how to get along with my fellow man.|Billy Graham|['god']
I used to sit near Marilyn Monroe in the Actor's Studio. She'd get dressed up because that was her identity. Sad. Those cameras wouldn't leave her alone. She didn't know where to hide.|Doris Roberts|['sad']
I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night, 'There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me dreaming of being a movie star.' But I'm not going to worry about them. I'm dreaming the hardest.|Marilyn Monroe|['alone']
I used to think like Moses. That knocked me down for a couple years and put me in prison. Then I start thinking like Job. Job waited and became the wealthiest and richest man ever 'cause he believed in God.|James Brown|['god']
I used to think that everything was just being funny but now I don't know. I mean, how can you tell?|Andy Warhol|['funny']
I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.|Shelby Foote|['poetry']
I value peace when it is not bought at the price of fundamental decencies.|Elia Kazan|['peace']
I venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people.|Edmund Burke|['war']

I very much wished not to be noticed, and to be left alone, and I sort of succeeded.|Mary Oliver|['alone']

I wake up in the morning, I do a little stretching exercises, pick up the horn and play.|Herb Alpert|['morning', 'music']

I want everyone to tell me the truth, even if it costs him his job.|Samuel Goldwyn|['truth']

I want my food dead. Not sick, not dying, dead.|Oscar Wilde|['food']

I want our government to encourage and protect freedom as well as our traditions of faith and family.|Jesse Helms|['faith']
I want peace. I want to see if somewhere there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.|Margaret Mitchell|['peace']
I want people to bow as they see me and say he is gifted with poetry, he has seen the presence of the creator.|Allen Ginsberg|['poetry']
I want the Arabic Granada, that which is art, which is all that seems to me beauty and emotion.|Isaac Albeniz|['beauty']

I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone.|Rainer Maria Rilke|['alone']

I want to encourage our people, to educate our people to have the courage to understand and fight for their rights.|Megawati Sukarnoputri|['courage']

I want to grow old without facelifts. I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face I have made.|Marilyn Monroe|['courage']
I want to have children, but my friends scare me. One of my friends told me she was in labor for 36 hours. I don't even want to do anything that feels good for 36 hours.|Rita Rudner|['parenting']
I want to keep my dreams, even bad ones, because without them, I might have nothing all night long.|Joseph Heller|['dreams']
I want to live my life so that my nights are not full of regrets.|David Herbert Lawrence|['life']
I want to make sure I don't interfere with the success of that team next year. I don't see any way I could go to practice like most of 'em do, and not hurt the team. I'd go nuts if I tried doing that.|Bear Bryant|['success']
I want to say that probably 24 hours after I told CBS that I was stepping down at my 65th birthday, I was already regretting it. And I regretted it every day since.|Walter Cronkite|['birthday']

I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family, to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team, too. They'd never seen anything like it.|Hayden Fry|['family']
I wanted to be a doctor that I might be able to work without having to talk because for years I had been giving myself out in words.|Albert Schweitzer|['work']
I wanted to be a great white hunter, a prospector for gold, or a slave trader. But then, when I was eight, my parents sent me to a boarding school in South Africa.

I was a vegetarian until I started leaning toward the sunlight.|Rita Rudner|['funny']
I was a woman in a man's world. I was a Democrat in a Republican administration. I was an intellectual in a world of bureaucrats. I talked differently. This may have made me a bit like an ink blot.|Jeane Kirkpatrick|['politics']
I was about half in love with her by the time we sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty... you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are.|J. D. Salinger|['love', 'time']
I was afraid of the internet... because I couldn't type.|Jack Welch|['computers']
I was also the romantic lead in The Boston Strangler - I was the only one that lived to tell the story - so I called myself the romantic lead.|Sally Kellerman|['romantic']

I was always attracted to science fiction movies.|Tina Turner|['movies', 'science']
I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within. It is there all the time.|Anna Freud|['strength']

I was an elementary school teacher.|Luciano Pavarotti|['teacher']
I was asked to act when I couldn't act. I was asked to sing 'Funny Face' when I couldn't sing, and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn't dance - and do all kinds of things I wasn't prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it.|Audrey Hepburn|['funny']

I was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom.

I was irrevocably betrothed to laughter, the sound of which has always seemed to me the most civilised music in the world.|Peter Ustinov|['music']

I was never less alone than when by myself.|Edward Gibbon|['alone']

I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6, but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life. I had no experience of fatherhood. I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit.|John le Carre|['experience', 'family']
I was raised by a lady that was crippled all her life but she did everything for me and she raised me. She washed our clothes, cooked our food, she did everything for us.

I went back to work because someone had to pay for the groceries.|Bette Davis|['work']

I'd like to say I was smart enough to finish six grades in five years, but I think perhaps the teacher was just glad to get rid of me.|Alan Shepard|['teacher']

I'd like to work with kids in special education - younger kids.|John Madden|['education']
I'd love to be a saxophonist. I don't know why, but I pretend I'm the saxophonist when I listen to music. I have about as much chance playing the sax as I do learning how to fly.|Richard Price|['learning']

I'll walk where my own nature would be leading: It vexes me to choose another guide.|Emily Bronte|['nature']
I'm 65 and I guess that puts me in with the geriatrics. But if there were fifteen months in every year, I'd only be 48. That's the trouble with us. We number everything. Take women, for example. I think they deserve to have more than twelve years between the ages of 28 and 40.|James Thurber|['women']

I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty.|James Lovelock|['religion']

I'm a workaholic. Before long I'm traveling on my nervous energy alone. This is incredibly exhausting.|Eva Gabor|['alone']

I'm convinced that the man who has learned to meditate upon the Lord will be able to run on his feet and walk in his spirit. Although he may be hurried by his vocation, that's not the issue. The issue is how fast his spirit is going. To slow it down takes a period of time.|Charles Stanley|['time']
I'm convinced there's a small room in the attic of the Foreign Office where future diplomats are taught to stammer.|Peter Ustinov|['future']

I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against.|Malcolm X|['truth']
I'm for whatever gets you through the night.|Frank Sinatra|['funny']

I'm glad I was a teacher.|John Wooden|['teacher']
I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.|Carol Burnett|['age', 'money']
I'm grateful to God for His bountiful gifts... He gave me courage and faith in myself.|Loretta Young|['courage', 'faith', 'god']
I'm happy to report that my inner child is still ageless.|James Broughton|['age']

I'm interested in all kinds of pictures, however they are made, with cameras, with paint brushes, with computers, with anything.|David Hockney|['computers']

I'm most proud of the longevity of my marriage, my kids, and my grandchildren. If you don't have that, you really don't have very much.|Bob Newhart|['marriage']
I'm moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn't clear. If people think you're leaving a show after all these years, you might be retiring.

I'm nearing the end of the road and still learning.|Mike Wallace|['learning']

I'm not a big fan of Women's Liberation, but maybe it will help women stand up for the respect they're due.|Loretta Lynn|['respect']
I'm not a driven businessman, but a driven artist. I never think about money. Beautiful things make money.|Lord Acton|['business', 'money']

My relationship with their mothers broke down and, because of what the law was, they went with their mothers and were imbued with their mothers' morality in life and they were not my people any more.|Wilbur Smith|['relationship']

I'm not a lawyer, and maybe I should have used more specific legal language.|Sonny Bono|['legal']
I'm not a music lover in the sense that I look for something to have on. I've never had that attitude to music.|Harrison Birtwistle|['attitude']
I'm not a power person. I like everyone to be on an equal footing.|Jack Nicholson|['power']
I'm not a prophet I can only use historical reality to come to a view of the future, and my view is that Africa will return to being African and not European.

I'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.|Karl Lagerfeld|['morning']
I'm not buddy-buddy with the players. If they need a buddy, let them buy a dog.|Whitey Herzog|['sports']
I'm not claiming that football is the nation's salvation in this area, but it's one of them, one little thing that apparently has captured the imagination of a large sector of our society. But when football can't be a relatively pure outlet, a fun thing, then it hurts itself.|Pete Rozelle|['imagination']
I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.|Jackie Robinson|['respect']
I'm not denyin' the women are foolish. God Almighty made 'em to match the men.|George Eliot|['god', 'men', 'women']

I'm not interested in trying to work on people's perceptions. I am who I am, and if you don't take the time to learn about that, then your perception is going to be your problem.|Jim Brown|['time', 'work']
I'm not into animal rights. I'm only into animal welfare and health. I've been with the Morris Animal Foundation since the '70s. We're a health organization. We fund campaign health studies for dogs, cats, lizards and wildlife. I've worked with the L.A. Zoo for about the same length of time. I get my animal fixes!|Betty White|['health']
I'm not involved in the politics of religion, but I love what the message is.|Jane Seymour|['politics', 'religion']
I'm not one of those complicated, mixed-up cats. I'm not looking for the secret to life... I just go on from day to day, taking what comes.|Frank Sinatra|['life']
I'm not really conservative. I'm conservative on certain things. I believe in less government. I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but don't any more.|Clint Eastwood|['government']
I'm not really quiet or shy. Ask any of my friends! But I always ground my poetry in life itself. Poetry is an art of language, though, so I am always aware of every word's meaning, or multiple meanings.|Anne Stevenson|['poetry']

I'm not ugly, but my beauty is a total creation.|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|['beauty']
I'm not up on the Internet, but I hear that is a democratic possibility. People can connect with each other. I think people are ready for something, but there is no leadership to offer it to them. People are ready to say, 'Yes, we are part of a world.'|Studs Terkel|['leadership']
I'm not what you might call sexy, but I'm romantic. Let's put it that way.|Betty White|['romantic']
I'm not wise, but the beginning of wisdom is there it's like relaxing into - and an acceptance of - things.|Tina Turner|['wisdom']

I'm one of the slowest drivers on the road. I mosey along. If you're doing anything too fast, including living life too fast, that creates sudden death. If I have to be somewhere on time, I make sure I leave early enough.|Anthony Hopkins|['death', 'time']
I'm only drinking white wine because I'm on a diet and I don't eat.|Oliver Reed|['diet']
I'm perfectly happy when I look out at an audience and it's all women. I always think it's kind of odd, but then, more women than men, I think, read and write poetry.|Diane Wakoski|['poetry']
I'm pleased to offer analysis of public policy and politics to the millions of Americans who get their news from Fox.|Evan Bayh|['politics']

I'm proud to pay taxes in the United States the only thing is, I could be just as proud for half the money.|Arthur Godfrey|['money']

I'm religiously opposed to religion.|Victor Hugo|['religion']

I'm set to have my best year ever: I'm hiring some acts and there will be a show in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. I'm going to use my theater to its fullest potential.|Mickey Gilley|['morning']

I'm still learning, you know. At 80, I feel there is a lot I don't know.|Lena Horne|['learning']
I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be.

I'm such a good lover because I practice a lot on my own.|Woody Allen|['good']
I'm supposed to have a Ph.D. on the subject of women. But the truth is I've flunked more often than not. I'm very fond of women I admire them. But, like all men, I don't understand them.|Frank Sinatra|['men', 'truth', 'women']
I'm sure I am impatient sometimes. I sure do get angry sometimes. I think it's outrageous how hard it is to get this country to feed its children and to take care of its children, to give them a decent education.|Marian Wright Edelman|['education']
I'm sure any vocal teacher that listens to me would rather cut my throat than do anything - I do everything all wrong - but I think for me that's the best - because I don't think I have a voice so I think what I project would be style - if I learned to sing I'd lose my style.|Julie London|['teacher']
I'm sure it is, I'm not for any kind of war, we've been engaged in several wars since the second world war and we lost in Korea, we lost in Vietnam, they are political wars, they have nothing to do with any real threat, nor does this one.|Larry Hagman|['war']
I'm sure that had I not been a coach, I would have been some form of a teacher.|John Madden|['teacher']

I'm the only person of distinction who has ever had a depression named for him.|Herbert Hoover|['history']
I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.|Andy Warhol|['home']
I'm tired of hearing it said that democracy doesn't work. Of course it doesn't work. We are supposed to work it.|Alexander Woollcott|['government', 'work']

I'm trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities, and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death.|Jack Kevorkian|['death', 'medical']

I'm very happy. I like my work and the various aspects of it - going around the world, teaching the gospel according to St. Albert.|Albert Ellis|['work']

I'm very shy really. I spend a lot of time in my room alone reading or writing or watching television.|Johnny Cash|['alone']

I'm working myself to death.|Alan Ladd|['death', 'work']
I'm world famous, everywhere I go there are people who love me because of I've been able to bring them some joy from the movies I've made.|Tony Curtis|['famous']

I've spent too much time giving speeches, traveling the world.|Billy Graham|['time']

It has always been my private conviction that any man who puts his intelligence up against a fish and loses had it coming.|John Steinbeck|['intelligence']
It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system.

And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.|John Steinbeck|['failure', 'love', 'men', 'success']

It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.|F. Scott Fitzgerald|['intelligence']

It's a slight stretch of the imagination but most people are alike in most ways so I've never had any trouble identifying with the character that I'm playing.|Jack Nicholson|['imagination']
It's a struggle but that's why we exist, so that another generation of Lesbians of color will not have to invent themselves, or their history, all over again.|Audre Lorde|['history']
It's a terrible thing to be alone - yes it is - it is - but don't lower your mask until you have another mask prepared beneath - as terrible as you like - but a mask.|Katherine Mansfield|['alone']
It's a tough thing, to know what to do about a war that deep in your gut you feel is wrong and yet watch your peers going off to fight in that war.|George McGovern|['war']
It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.|Alan Shepard|['government']
It's about time we make the well-being of our young people more important than ideology and politics. As a country, we benefit from investing in their future by investing in teen pregnancy prevention.|Jane Fonda|['future', 'politics', 'teen']
It's all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.|Andrew Wyeth|['design']
It's almost seems as though there's a battle going on between the public and all the fast-food establishments, and, believe me, I think it's very tasty food.|Regis Philbin|['food']
It's amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like, instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.|Carlisle Floyd|['amazing']
It's amazing how much you can learn if your intentions are truly earnest.|Chuck Berry|['amazing']
It's amazing how, age after age, in country after country, and in all languages, Shakespeare emerges as incomparable.|M. H. Abrams|['amazing']
It's amazing. I can't believe how brilliant the whole thing is - my daughter, Georgia, is just wonderful.|Edward Hall|['amazing']
It's an awesome responsibility, not only to maintain the level of success the NFL has, but to build on that.|Roger Goodell|['success']
It's an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.|Robert Redford|['art', 'politics']
It's an incredible con job when you think about it, to believe something now in exchange for something after death. Even corporations with their reward systems don't try to make it posthumous.|Gloria Steinem|['death']
It's at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys.|Emil Zatopek|['men']
It's been mentioned or suggested that Paradise will not be well studied, because it's about this unimportant intellectual topic, which is religion.|Toni Morrison|['religion']
It's been my experience that every time I think I know where it's at, it's usually somewhere else.|Blake Edwards|['experience']
It's best to have failure happen early in life. It wakes up the Phoenix bird in you so you rise from the ashes.|Anne Baxter|['best', 'failure']
It's best to leap into something you know you love. You might change your mind later, but that is the privilege of youth.|Charles Kuralt|['change']
It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.|Elizabeth Kenny|['life', 'wisdom']
It's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far.|Marilyn Monroe|['alone']
It's better to get mugged than to live a life of fear.|Freeman Dyson|['fear']
It's better to have loved and lost than to have to do forty pounds of laundry a week.|Laurence J. Peter|['valentinesday']
It's clever, but is it Art?|Rudyard Kipling|['art']
It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.|David Attenborough|['change', 'food', 'home']
It's commonly said that people who've been ill in childhood and who've had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don't look at the world in the way that other people do, and if you were inclined to be a writer, that's a help.|John Keegan|['education']
It's cool to be healthy.|Dick Gregory|['cool']
It's developing a relationship with actors that makes it work.|Richard Donner|['relationship']
It's easier to force feed people than it is to give 'em what they want. It makes more money.|Merle Haggard|['money']
It's easier to replace a dead man than a good picture.|George Bernard Shaw|['good']
It's easy being a humorist when you've got the whole government working for you.|Will Rogers|['government']
It's easy to have faith in yourself and have discipline when you're a winner, when you're number one. What you got to have is faith and discipline when you're not a winner.|Vince Lombardi|['faith']
It's easy to sit in relative luxury and peace and pontificate on the subject of the Third World debts.|Roger Moore|['peace']
It's every teenager's dream to be in a band, tour the world and be famous.|Joey McIntyre|['famous']
It's fun to be a part of pop history. Anytime you can be referenced in that respect it can be cool.|Joey McIntyre|['cool']
It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.|Hedy Lamarr|['funny', 'women']
It's funny to be a critic.|Leslie Fiedler|['funny']
It's funny what a few no-hitters do for a body.|Satchel Paige|['funny']
It's funny. All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they'll do practically anything you want them to.|J. D. Salinger|['funny']
It's good sportsmanship to not pick up lost golf balls while they are still rolling.|Mark Twain|['good', 'sports']
It's good to have money and the things that money can buy, but it's good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure that you haven't lost the things that money can't buy.|George Horace Lorimer|['money']
It's good to trust others but, not to do so is much better.|Benito Mussolini|['good', 'trust']
It's grown into a personal relationship, yeah. I'm crazy about Jerry. I think he's a unique character.|Jon Voight|['relationship']
It's hard for me to think of others because I'm not particularly in sympathy with the music of this century.|Alan Hovhaness|['sympathy']
It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.|Jane Fonda|['age']
It's hard to be funny when you have to be clean.|Mae West|['funny']
It's hard to pay attention these days because of multiple affects of the information technology nowadays. You tend to develop a faster, speedier mind, but I don't think it's necessarily broader or smarter.|Robert Redford|['technology']
It's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success.|Charlotte Whitton|['failure']
It's human nature to gripe, but I'm going ahead and doing the best I can.|Elvis Presley|['best', 'nature']
It's human nature to start taking things for granted again when danger isn't banging loudly on the door.|David Hackworth|['nature']
It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.|Jane Seymour|['cool', 'wedding']
It's interesting that whenever I meet some of the other Bond girls, I always have something in common, and it is an interesting sorority. We all share about our Bonds. 'Did your Bond do that?' 'Yes mine did!' So it is quite funny conversations. We may as well be in high school.|Jane Seymour|['funny']
It's just as idiotic to say there is no life after death as it is to say there is one.|Jeanne Moreau|['death']
It's life isn't it? You plow ahead and make a hit. And you plow on and someone passes you. Then someone passes them. Time levels.|Katharine Hepburn|['time']
It's like kids playing house: 'You play the father, I'll play the mother.' You know, you dress up, you play, they pay, you go home. It's a game - acting's a game.|Robert Duvall|['home']
It's morally wrong to allow a sucker to keep his money.|W. C. Fields|['money']
It's motive alone which gives character to the actions of men.|Jean de la Bruyere|['alone']
It's my firm intention to whop cancer into submission and I truly believe I've given myself the best start possible by radically overhauling my diet and by staying true to my motto, which is: Don't worry, be happy, feel good. The first thing I did when I was diagnosed was to turn vegan.|Larry Hagman|['diet']
It's never acceptable to target civilians. It violates the Geneva Accords, it violates the international law of war and it violates all principles of morality.|Alan Dershowitz|['war']
It's never occurred to me to worry about my health, or that I'll get old, or that people will stop laughing at me.|Frank Carson|['health']
It's nice to know that people appreciate and respect you.|Marcel Carne|['respect']
It's no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying, 'Really, I was meant to be a ballet dancer.' By then, pigs will be your style.|Quentin Crisp|['good']
It's no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.|Jiddu Krishnamurti|['health', 'society']
It's no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.|Mark Twain|['truth']
It's none of their business that you have to learn how to write. Let them think you were born that way.|Ernest Hemingway|['business']
It's not beauty but fine qualities, my girl, that keep a husband.|Euripides|['beauty', 'marriage']
It's not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us it's the way people look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses.|Virginia Woolf|['age']
It's not going to do any good to land on Mars if we're stupid.|Ray Bradbury|['good']
It's not good for government to tell people that the world owes them a living and that things are free.|William Weld|['government']
It's not just the NFL. Every other league has a draft. It has been fundamental to the success of professional sports.|Roger Goodell|['sports', 'success']
It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.|Albert Einstein|['intelligence']
It's not that I'm universally loved. We know I'm not in New Jersey. But what they do say in New Jersey is, 'We like him, and we think he's telling us the truth.' I think we need to have that type of politics on the national level.|Chris Christie|['politics']
It's not that the Irish are cynical. It's rather that they have a wonderful lack of respect for everything and everybody.|Brendan Behan|['respect']
It's not the men in my life that count, it's the life in my men.|Mae West|['life', 'men']
It's not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions.|Norman Mailer|['history']
It's not the voting that's democracy it's the counting.|Tom Stoppard|['government']
It's not the work which kills people, it's the worry. It's not the revolution that destroys machinery it's the friction.|Henry Ward Beecher|['work']
It's not tyranny we desire it's a just, limited, federal government.|Alexander Hamilton|['government']
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.|Henry David Thoreau|['wisdom']
It's not what you pay a man, but what he costs you that counts.|Will Rogers|['business']
It's often just enough to be with someone. I don't need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You're not alone.|Marilyn Monroe|['alone']
It's one thing to be religious, but it's another thing to make religion your policy.|Madeleine Albright|['religion']
It's only I have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now, I know that I'm skinny, because I know there are even smaller clothes in the store. I think I'm big, when I was big, I never thought about it.|Karl Lagerfeld|['funny']
It's only fair that stable gay relationships of long standing should have the same rights and responsibilities as married couples. I know the image of gay marriage is to some people horrific and ludicrous.|Ian Mckellen|['marriage']
It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up, we will then begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had.|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross|['time']
It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please.|Rose Kennedy|['money']
It's part of a writer's profession, as it's part of a spy's profession, to prey on the community to which he's attached, to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters, whether it's his readership or his spy masters. And I think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely.|John le Carre|['intelligence']
It's rather naive, apart from being ethically objectionable, to assume that our investigators travel around the country with bags of money trying to bribe witnesses to lie on the witness stand. We just don't operate that way.|Jim Garrison|['money', 'travel']
It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.|Anne Frank|['good']
It's sad - it's sad for us old enough to remember when directors ruled, and films were substantially better than they are today. But it's hard to argue with those kinds of grosses.|Mark Rydell|['sad']
It's said in Hollywood that you should always forgive your enemies - because you never know when you'll have to work with them.|Lana Turner|['forgiveness', 'work']
It's so sad: anything that has to do with God, people want to dispel.|Sylvia Browne|['sad']
It's such a beautiful sport, with no politics involved, no color, no class. Only as a youngster can you play and as a pro can you win. The game has kept me young, involved and excited and for me to be up here with gems of baseball.|Jack Buck|['politics']
It's tempting to say the Ph.D. didn't have an effect, but it's not so. I think whatever resonance I may be able to achieve is in part simply from the amount of reading and learning that I acquired along the way.|Robert B. Parker|['learning']
It's the continuation of everyone's childhood to see these young children who grow up full of life, full of intelligence, full of a sense of wonder. And within an instant they're gone from this world. It's terrible.|Lucien Bouchard|['intelligence']
It's the degree of success and the length of time that is amazing.|Ruth Handler|['amazing']
It's the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter.|Marlene Dietrich|['friendship']
It's the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It's not about age. It's about taste, and it's about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything.|Ralph Lauren|['age', 'women']
It's the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it.|Andy Warhol|['movies']
It's the same each time with progress. First they ignore you, then they say you're mad, then dangerous, then there's a pause and then you can't find anyone who disagrees with you.|Tony Benn|['time']
It's time to let science and medicine, not politics and rhetoric, lead us to good, sound policy.|Eliot Spitzer|['politics', 'science']
It's to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business, as it were, and I use almost pure turpentine to start with, adding oil as I go along until the medium becomes pure oil. I use as little oil as I can possibly help, and that's my method.|Edward Hopper|['business', 'funny']
It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.|Rodney Dangerfield|['marriage']
It's true that General Musharraf opposes my return, seeing me as a symbol of democracy in the country. He is comfortable with dictatorship. I hope better sense prevails.|Benazir Bhutto|['hope']
It's up to the courage of the filmmakers to make art in cinema, not just business. John was rejected by studios, he borrowed money and did movies with his own money. You're either courageous or not. You have to find a way.|Ben Gazzara|['courage']
It's useless to hold a person to anything he says while he's in love, drunk, or running for office.|Shirley MacLaine|['love']
It's very attractive to people to be a victim. Instead of having to think out the whole situation, about history and your group and what you are doing... if you begin from the point of view of being a victim, you've got it half-made. I mean intellectually.|V. S. Naipaul|['history']
It's very difficult to break into motion pictures, but it's oddly easier for directors today because of independent films and cable, who have inherited for the most part those films of substance that the studios are reluctant to finance.|Mark Rydell|['finance']
It's very hard to know what wisdom is.|James Hillman|['wisdom']
It's very important to write things down instantly, or you can lose the way you were thinking out a line. I have a rule that if I wake up at 3 in the morning and think of something, I write it down. I can't wait until morning - it'll be gone.|Mary Oliver|['morning']
It's very much like opera singers. They do the same thing. The first thing in the morning and the last thing at night, the thing they think about is their voice and how to take care of it.|Johnny Mathis|['morning']
It's very personal in its politics, very bitter and very negative.|John Bolton|['politics']
It's very trying on a marriage when you're doing a one hour show, week after week after week. You don't have enough time for people that maybe you should have top priority.|Gavin MacLeod|['marriage']
It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.|John Wooden|['learning']
It's with bad sentiments that one makes good novels.|Aldous Huxley|['good']
It's wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears.|Helen Keller|['god', 'religion']
It's wonderful to travel with somebody that you love and we never travel anywhere without one another.|Roger Moore|['travel']
It's your outlook on life that counts. If you take yourself lightly and don't take yourself too seriously, pretty soon you can find the humor in our everyday lives. And sometimes it can be a lifesaver.|Betty White|['humor']
January is the garbage can of movies in America, directly after all the Oscar contenders have been out.|Michael Caine|['movies']
Japanese architecture is very much copied in this country and in Europe.|Minoru Yamasaki|['architecture']
Jazz is a very democratic musical form. It comes out of a communal experience. We take our respective instruments and collectively create a thing of beauty.|Max Roach|['beauty']
Jazz is about freedom within discipline. Usually a dictatorship like in Russia and Germany will prevent jazz from being played because it just seemed to represent freedom, democracy and the United States.|Dave Brubeck|['freedom']
Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.|Art Blakey|['art']
Jazz is the big brother of the blues. If a guy's playing blues like we play, he's in high school. When he starts playing jazz it's like going on to college, to a school of higher learning.|B. B. King|['learning']
Jazz stands for freedom. It's supposed to be the voice of freedom: Get out there and improvise, and take chances, and don't be a perfectionist - leave that to the classical musicians.|Dave Brubeck|['freedom']
Jazz to me is a living music. It's a music that since its beginning has expressed the feelings, the dreams, hopes, of the people.|Dexter Gordon|['dreams']
Jazz took too much discipline. You have to come in at the right place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, baby,' if there's a pause in the melody. With jazz, you better leave that space open, or put in something real cool.|Etta James|['cool']
Jealousy is both reasonable and belongs to reasonable men, while envy is base and belongs to the base, for the one makes himself get good things by jealousy, while the other does not allow his neighbour to have them through envy.|Aristotle|['good', 'jealousy', 'men']
Jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire.|Solomon Ibn Gabirol|['jealousy']
Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.|George Eliot|['jealousy']
Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies.|Elizabeth Bowen|['alone', 'jealousy']
Jealousy is the fear of comparison.|Max Frisch|['fear', 'jealousy']
Jealousy is the fear or apprehension of superiority: envy our uneasiness under it.|William Shenstone|['fear', 'jealousy']
Jealousy is the grave of affection.|Mary Baker Eddy|['jealousy']
Jealousy is the jaundice of the soul.|John Dryden|['jealousy']
Jealousy is, I think, the worst of all faults because it makes a victim of both parties.|Gene Tierney|['jealousy']
Jesse Jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and open our minds and stir our very souls.|Ann Richards|['teacher']
Jesus Christ is a prince of peace. He told us to live in peace. He told us to love our enemies. He told us to do good to them that spitefully use us.|Pat Robertson|['peace']
Jesus didn't say, 'Blessed are those who care for the poor.' He said, 'Blessed are we where we are poor, where we are broken.' It is there that God loves us deeply and pulls us into deeper communion with himself.|Henri Nouwen|['god']
Jesus does not give recipes that show the way to God as other teachers of religion do. He is himself the way.|Karl Barth|['god', 'religion']
Jesus is the God whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair.|Blaise Pascal|['god']
Jesus wept Voltaire smiled. From that divine tear and from that human smile is derived the grace of present civilization.|Victor Hugo|['smile']
Jewelry and pins have been worn throughout history as symbols of power, sending messages. Interestingly enough, it was mostly men who wore the jewelry in various times, and obviously crowns were part of signals that were being sent throughout history by people of rank.|Madeleine Albright|['history', 'power']
Jews have had to carry around their own sense of self in a carpet bag and I think perhaps too much emphasis might be being put on nationality and on the other hand patriotism, that sort of thing.|Janet Suzman|['patriotism']
Jobs for every American is doomed to failure because of modern automation and production. We ought to recognize it and create an income-maintenance system so every single American has the dignity and the wherewithal for shelter, basic food, and medical care. I'm talking about welfare for all. Without it, you're going to have warfare for all.|Jerry Brown|['failure', 'medical']
Jogging is very beneficial. It's good for your legs and your feet. It's also very good for the ground. If makes it feel needed.|Charles M. Schulz|['fitness', 'good']
John Candy knew he was going to die. He told me on his 40th birthday. He said, well, Maureen, I'm on borrowed time.|Maureen O'Hara|['birthday', 'death']
John Dalton's records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester. It is not only the living who are killed in war.|Isaac Asimov|['war']
John Ford was so funny that I couldn't wait to go to work in the morning.|Richard Widmark|['morning']
John wrote with a very deep love for the human race and a concern for its future.|Yoko Ono|['future']
Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the '50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together.I would hear him sing every night.|Etta James|['car']
Join the union, girls, and together say Equal Pay for Equal Work.|Susan B. Anthony|['work']
Journalism is concerned with events, poetry with feelings. Journalism is concerned with the look of the world, poetry with the feel of the world.|Archibald MacLeish|['poetry']
Journalism wishes to tell what it is that has happened everywhere as though the same things had happened for every man. Poetry wishes to say what it is like for any man to be himself in the presence of a particular occurrence as though only he were alone there.|Archibald MacLeish|['poetry']
Journalists say a thing that they know isn't true, in the hope that if they keep on saying it long enough it will be true.|Arnold Bennett|['hope']
Joy in looking and comprehending is nature's most beautiful gift.|Albert Einstein|['nature']
Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.|Mother Teresa|['love']
Joy's smile is much closer to tears than laughter.|Victor Hugo|['smile']
Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams.|Ralph Waldo Emerson|['dreams']
Judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.|Simon Bolivar|['experience']
Judges are the weakest link in our system of justice, and they are also the most protected.|Alan Dershowitz|['legal']
Judging from the main portions of the history of the world, so far, justice is always in jeopardy.|Walt Whitman|['history']
Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities.|Friedrich Nietzsche|['life']
Just about this time, when in imagination I was so great a warrior, I had good use in real life for more strength, as I was no longer taken to school by the nurse, but instead had myself to protect my brother, two years my junior.|Georg Brandes|['imagination', 'strength']
Just after World War II, this country led the world in science by every way you could measure it, yet the number of scientists was a tiny proportion of what it is now.|James Lovelock|['science', 'war']
Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.|Sigmund Freud|['alone', 'happiness', 'wisdom']
Just as a man would not cherish living in a body other than his own, so do nations not like to live under other nations, however noble and great the latter may be.|Mahatma Gandhi|['great']
Just as a mother finds pleasure in taking her little child on her lap, there to feed and caress him, in like manner our loving God shows His fondness for His beloved souls who have given themselves entirely to Him and have placed all their hope in His goodness.|Alphonsus Liguori|['god', 'hope', 'mom']
Just as characteristic, perhaps, is the intellectual interdependence created through the development of the modern media of communication: post, telegraph, telephone, and popular press.|Christian Lous Lange|['communication']
Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it.|Leonardo da Vinci|['courage', 'fear']
Just as everybody has the vote including women, I think children should, because as a child is conscious of itself then it has to me an existence and has a stake in what happens.|Gertrude Stein|['women']
Just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of facts.|Henri Poincare|['science']
Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God.|Soren Kierkegaard|['god', 'love']
Just as man can't exist without his body, so no rights can exist without the right to translate one's rights into reality, to think, to work and keep the results, which means: the right of property.|Ayn Rand|['work']
Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality.|Erich Fromm|['equality']
Just as the Russians and the Soviets didn't manage to wipe out languages in Lithuania, neither have they managed to wipe out religion to the extent that we had feared.|Jeane Kirkpatrick|['religion']
Just as the Security Council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century - freedom against Communism - so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.|John Bolton|['freedom']
Just as the left has to be more willing to question 'Government knows best,' the right has to rethink its laissez-faire attitude toward government.|Jack Kemp|['attitude']
Just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany, so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology.|Edward Thorndike|['education', 'science']
Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not seen. Just as the soul feeds the body, so God gives food to the world.|Marcus Tullius Cicero|['food', 'god', 'religion']
Just as the wave cannot exist for itself, but is ever a part of the heaving surface of the ocean, so must I never live my life for itself, but always in the experience which is going on around me.|Albert Schweitzer|['experience']
Just because I managed to do a little something, I don't want anyone back home to think I got the big head.|Elvis Presley|['home']
Just because scientists have the knowledge to do it, the technology to do it, and some may even have a financial motive or other incentive to do it, does not make it right.|Nathan Deal|['knowledge', 'technology']
Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do doesn't mean it's useless.|Thomas A. Edison|['business']
Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you.|Pericles|['politics']
Just because you liked something as a youngster doesn't mean you have to like it as an adult. You can change your taste a little bit on the sweets and things like that.|Mike Ditka|['change']
Just because you put higher-octane gasoline in your car doesn't mean you can break the speed limit. The speed limit's still 65.|Neil Sheehan|['car']
Just call me a family man and an actor who digs his whole scene, side interests and all. Just say I feel mighty good at the ripe old age of 27.|Bobby Darin|['age']
Just do the best you can. No one can do more than that.|John Wooden|['best']
Just do what must be done. This may not be happiness, but it is greatness.|George Bernard Shaw|['happiness']

Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.|Hans Christian Anderson|['freedom', 'nature']
Just stop for a minute and you'll realize you're happy just being. I think it's the pursuit that screws up happiness. If we drop the pursuit, it's right here.|James Hillman|['happiness']
Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don't move.|Satchel Paige|['home']
Just that working with Clint again is like coming home.|Morgan Freeman|['home']

We are also further than ever from equality of opportunity.|Ferdinand Mount|['equality']

We are free to yield to truth.|Horace|['truth']

We are living in the excesses of freedom. Just take a look at 42nd Street and Broadway.|Will Durant|['freedom']

We are persuaded that good Christians will always be good citizens, and that where righteousness prevails among individuals the Nation will be great and happy.

We are what our thoughts have made us so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live they travel far.|Swami Vivekananda|['travel']

We cannot always assure the future of our friends we have a better chance of assuring our future if we remember who our friends are.|Henry A. Kissinger|['future']

We cannot have that relationship if we only dictate or threaten and condemn those who disagree.|Zbigniew Brzezinski|['relationship']

We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true.

We have perhaps a natural fear of ends. We would rather be always on the way than arrive. Given the means, we hang on to them and often forget the ends.|Eric Hoffer|['fear']

We learn about life not from plusses alone, but from minuses as well.|Anton Chekhov|['alone']

We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.|Lloyd Alexander|['learning']

Well, I always had a chauffer, because I have never driven a car in my life. I still can't drive.|Bud Abbott|['car']

What I like about music is the songs you can remember the lines of in a single second.|Karl Lagerfeld|['music']
